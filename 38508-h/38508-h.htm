<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Page v]</span></p>
<p>As the name of the author of this book may
not be so well known to some English
readers as it is on the Continent, I have, at his
request, undertaken to write a few lines of
introduction and preface.</p>

<p>Count Vay de Vaya and Luskod is a member
of one of the oldest and most distinguished
families of Hungary. Ever since his ancestor
took part with King Stephen in the foundation
of the Hungarian Kingdom, nine hundred years
ago, the members of his family, in succeeding
generations, have been eminent in the service
of that state.</p>

<p>The Count studied at various European universities,
and was destined for the diplomatic
service, but early in life he decided to take
Holy Orders and devote himself to the work
of the Church.</p>

<p>In this capacity he attended the Diamond
Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 as one of the
envoys of Pope Leo XIII.</p>

<p>The chief enterprise of his life, however, has
been to study the work of the Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span>
Church in all parts of the world&mdash;her missions,
charitable institutions, schools, and organizations
of all kinds.</p>

<p>Few men have travelled so far and into such
remote quarters as the Count Vay de Vaya has,
with this object. His position has secured for
him access to the leading and most accomplished
circles wherever he has been, and his linguistic
attainments, as well as his wide personal experience
of men and affairs in every quarter
of the globe, give him an almost unique opportunity
of describing and commenting on the
countries which he has visited&mdash;their people,
rulers, and institutions.</p>

<p>Seldom has any region been subjected to
such complete and revolutionary changes as
have the countries which he describes in the
following pages.</p>

<p>Russia has been compelled to relax that grip
on the Far East which seemed to be permanently
tightening and closing: at home she has been
subjected to a social upheaval which at one time
threatened the existing form of government
and the throne itself. And for the first time
we have witnessed the triumph of an Asiatic
race over one of the leading Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>The substance of this volume was written
in 1902 and the following year, before any of
these events had occurred, or were dreamed of,
and this may cause some of the details of the<span class="pagenum">[vii]</span>
record to be a little out of date historically;
but the change, far from diminishing, has, on
the whole, probably increased its value to all
thoughtful readers.</p>

<p>A few passages of comment and forecast
have been added since the occurrence of the
war, but in the main the narrative remains as
it was originally written.</p>

<p>Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and the Siberian
Railway have been described over and over
again, both during and since the war, but descriptions
of them on the eve of the outbreak may
come with some freshness and enable readers
to compare what was yesterday with what is
today.</p>

<p>And what has been changed in the "Unchanging
East" bears but a very small proportion
to what remains the same in spite of wars and
revolutions.</p>

<p>I hope, therefore, that these first impressions
of countries which, in name at any rate, are
far more familiar to the British public than they
were four or five years ago, may prove of great
interest to many readers in England and
America.</p>

<p>The chapters on <i>The Tsar of all the Russias</i>,
<i>The Reception at the Summer Palace</i>, <i>The Audience
of the Emperor of Korea</i>, and <i>The Mikado
and the Empress</i>, appeared in "Pearson's
Magazine," and thanks are due to the Editor for<span class="pagenum">[viii]</span>
kind permission to reprint them. The chapters
on <i>Manchuria under Russian Rule</i> first appeared
in the "Revue des deux Mondes," and those on
<i>Japan and China in the Twentieth Century</i> in
the "Deutsche Rundschau," but none of these
have been translated into English before. The
whole has been carefully revised, and considerable
additions have been made.</p>

<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[xvii]</span></p>
<p>During my prolonged stay in the Far
East, I promised to send home notes whenever
I came across anything interesting, or
whenever I had time to do so. This is how it
happened that the story of my visits to the different
cities of interest, of receptions graciously
granted by the various Emperors of Eastern
Asia, and the chief impressions received when
crossing their empires, came to be jotted down.</p>

<p>Naturally in these pages, written often under
considerable pressure and in spare moments, I
was at the mercy of circumstances, and could not
dwell on all the points at such length as I should
have liked to do. In short, in these narratives,
destined to be confided to couriers and post
offices, I was compelled to leave out much that
might have been more sensational.</p>

<p>Some of the papers have already appeared
in periodicals, and the appreciation that has
kindly been shown to them, and the favourable
criticism they have received, have been due to
the sincerity and the absolute lack of pretension
with which I have tried to treat the different
subjects.</p>

<p>My intention was simply to note what was<span class="pagenum">[xviii]</span>
striking at the moment and what impressed
me most vividly. I have tried to be as objective
as possible, and to deal with things as they
are, not as I could have wished to find them.
Even in the most attractive books that have
dealt with these far-off countries, there has
sometimes been a tendency to adopt the tone
of a mentor and to judge everything from a
superior standpoint, as if the complete difference
between those remote lands and peoples and
our own had been forgotten, and as if the Westerner
wished to ignore a civilization which,
though different from, is not less serious than his
own; in short, as though this mysterious Far
East, with its almost incomprehensible masses,
did not possess anything at all of a higher nature
and lacked a mind altogether.</p>

<p>Certainly it is difficult, almost impossible, for
an alien to perceive their inner qualities and
mental powers; at the same time we shall
have opportunities in our everyday lives of
noting explanatory manifestations. It is from
living in the same atmosphere and from continual
intercourse with all classes, high and low,
that it will be given us to understand a little of
what is called the soul of a land and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thus, while describing events in their simplicity,
we may succeed in giving something of
the local atmosphere too. This is the reason<span class="pagenum">[xix]</span>
why we always read with pleasure memoirs of
past generations or correspondences from far-away
countries or of days gone by; and why
all the best descriptions in books dealing with
the Far East are those unassuming and faded
letters from merchants or missionaries; and why
the narrative of Marco Polo, with all its <i>naïveté</i>,
will remain for all ages a standard work.</p>

<p>Strange adventures, depicted in brilliant hues
and by an exaggerated imagination, seldom help
our general knowledge. Instead of adding to
what we see and encumbering real facts with
more or less imaginary occurrences, it is more
useful to omit unnecessary details, just as the
important thing in painting a landscape is to
know what to leave out, so as to make the
general character of the scenery clearer. This
it is that constitutes the difference between
the very best photograph or chromo-lithograph
and a rough artistic study or water-colour sketch.
In short, one ought to strive to treat this land
as its painters do their sketches, always bearing
in mind their design of giving in a masterly
manner general impressions more than worthless
details, so as to get hold of something more
than can be seen&mdash;something of abstract value
in the life they are endeavouring to render.</p>

<p>It was life with its everyday occupations that
brought me into contact with all social phases,
and rendered my journey and stay of interest,<span class="pagenum">[xx]</span>
and made it possible for me to see the country
and people in a stronger light than if I had been
an ordinary traveller. I was investigating the
civilizing, charitable, and spiritual work carried
on by the Catholic Church under different conditions,
amongst various races. These matters
I have dealt with in another volume; but even
the subjects that I treated of in those unassuming
pages may have acquired a certain
local colour, as having been seen by one who
had interests and ties with the places he wrote
from, and the people he lived amongst.</p>

<p>During the year I passed in the countries
bordering on the Yellow Sea, I had an opportunity
of making the acquaintance of the greater
number of those eminent persons whose names
have lately been so often in the mouths of all
the world. It was most interesting to listen
to them and to hear their views. Though there
may have been great diversity in their opinions,
they were none the less instructive for that.</p>

<p>My departure from St. Petersburg presented
the first glimpse into Orientalism. The splendour
of the Imperial City, and the patriarchal
condition of the lower classes, gave it a different
character from the usual European capitals,
and the network of interests in the metropolis
differs even more. I had to stay rather longer
than I had expected, and this prolongation gave
me the best chance of making the amplest preparations,<span class="pagenum">[xxi]</span>
and acquiring the necessary preliminary
knowledge for my journey across the
empire.</p>

<p>Moreover, since as an ecclesiastic I had to
obtain special permission even to get to Russia,
it was therefore natural that I should have
expected to find the greatest difficulties and
complications thrown in the way of the accomplishment
of my future journey.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kindness of the Tsar himself,
however, all possible obstacles were smoothed
over. He was personally acquainted with the
journey that awaited me, but with this difference,
that he made it before the railway was
completed, and travelled by post. It was
interesting to listen to the narrative of the
sovereign, giving his impressions of the remotest
portions of his empire, where he could not but
come into contact with all classes of his subjects,
and where he was obliged to share the vicissitudes
of "inflexible circumstance," as we so often
read in official <i>ukases</i>.</p>

<p>His Majesty evidently took the liveliest interest
in everything he saw, and gave charming
accounts of his personal experiences. As in all
royal tours, everything was naturally shown to
him in as favourable a light as possible, and yet,
apparently, the shadows had not altogether
escaped his observation. Being heir to all this
enormous territory, he probably traversed it<span class="pagenum">[xxii]</span>
full of hope of being able one day to ameliorate
the general condition of his country, and to
prove a true and loving "Little Father" to his
folk. It is indeed a melancholy reflection that
those who are generally supposed to be blindly
obeyed, to have all their wishes accomplished,
and whose will is imagined to be absolutely
autocratic, are those who are most tied by the
<i>force majeur</i>.</p>

<p>The little hermitage of Alexandrovsky, nestling
in pine woods, with its home-like character,
stands, like an oasis, in the midst of Peterhof,
that town of palaces and splendour. The simplicity
of the Imperial family is in striking contrast
with the luxury of the so-called Court
circle. All that one hears of the ostentation
and extravagance of Russian Court life entirely
disappears when one comes to know the home
of the Tsar and Tsaritsa.</p>

<p>Elsewhere there is undoubtedly much pomp
and glitter, for the luxury and lavishness of
Russian officialism is too well known to need
mention here. Indeed, there is hardly a country
where things are done more elaborately, and
the Exchequer seems to be inexhaustible. If the
administration leaves much to be desired and
cannot be criticized too severely, we must allow
that the officials themselves are the most accomplished
men we could wish to know. Whether
an official be a minister of State, with all the<span class="pagenum">[xxiii]</span>
polish of the old régime of the eighteenth century,
or a simple <i>tchinovnik</i>, a tram conductor
or a railway guard, it is equally pleasant to
have dealings with him.</p>

<p>A stay of a few weeks in St. Petersburg, filled
with receptions at the residences of the various
members of the Imperial family, calls at the
Embassies, official visits, sight-seeing, and business
of all sorts, certainly gives one ample
opportunity to gain a better insight into local
matters than the study of whole volumes.</p>

<p>It was on the eve of the war that I was there.
The atmosphere was full of gunpowder, and
yet nobody seemed to believe that such a thing
could happen; or, even if it really came to
pass, that it could have greater consequences
than the annihilation of that far-away island
folk, of whom the Russian world seemed to
know very little. For just as they are so well
informed and interested in Western affairs,
that one might fancy oneself in a suburb of
Paris, so they are supremely indifferent to, and
have very hazy ideas of what they call the
"Barbarous East."</p>

<p>Such was public opinion and such the tone
adopted by the newspapers. M. de Witte was
the only man who seemed to be of another conviction.
He was just then on his way back
from Port Arthur and Dalny. He had been on
the spot and realized the situation. He had<span class="pagenum">[xxiv]</span>
planned and built Dalny with a view to having
a great commercial stronghold to command the
Far East, in opposition to his neighbour,
Kuropatkin, who commanded the fortifications
of Port Arthur. He believed that the best
foundation for Russia's supremacy lay in industrial
development; Kuropatkin trusted in the
sword. Witte was dismissed&mdash;the rest we know.</p>

<p>Moscow, my next stoppage, revealed another
side of the empire. The holy Moscow, the
Mother of Cities, exhibited other features of
interest illustrative of the mystical Slavonic
soul. The Kremlin, with its gilt cupolas, is not
only a monument unique of its kind, but also
the expression of a nation's sentiment.</p>

<p>The history of the past, the aspirations of the
future, are equally manifested. The glory of
arms, of arts, of thought, is expressed in this
Valhalla. It is the embodiment of the word
"Muscovite," which means all that is characteristic
of Russia. Light and shadow, brightness
and gloom, virtues and vices, are equally perceptible
in this marvellous city, and what is
not visible is even more impressive.</p>

<p>All the transcendental tendencies, the shadowy
mysticism, peculiar to this strange population,
all that is abstract, finds new and unexpected
expression within these venerable walls. Patriotism
and anarchy, faith and superstition,
walk side by side. Churches, shrines, and<span class="pagenum">[xxv]</span>
ikons are met at every corner, and before them
all, large groups are on their knees, prostrated
in devotion. In this same city the most terrible
crimes are committed, and the same populace
that seemed so repentant and contrite, perpetrates
the most cruel and bloody outrages.</p>

<p>In fact, Moscow is an inexhaustible field of
study, and not only for historical research, but also
for a more certain knowledge of this paradoxical
race, full as it is of inexplicable contrasts and
incessant surprises.</p>

<p>Siberia was another mine of contrasts and
surprises, and the longer I was there the more
I began to comprehend the vast possibilities
of this formidable stretch of country. It is a
continent in itself, with all the natural advantages
to enable it to become rich and prosperous.
Her future development has the same chance
as that of Canada, and her wealth is even larger.
To say nothing of Siberia's inexhaustible mines,
the land is better watered, and the timber-forests
even more extensive.</p>

<p>The population is still slumbering in its
cradle. The life they lead is archaic in the
extreme. They dwell mostly in tents, lead a
nomadic life, and provide their own clothing
and food themselves.</p>

<p>They are uneducated, but not unintelligent.
In fact, after having visited different camps, I
was most struck with their open expression and<span class="pagenum">[xxvi]</span>
self-reliance. But it must not be forgotten
that, in contradistinction to the Slavs of Russia
proper, the various tribes of the Ural-Altai
race have never been serfs. They have always
led a wandering, independent existence under
their Hetmans.</p>

<p>The Baskirs and the Kirghiz are the most
interesting, and are the finest specimens of
Mid-Asiatic types. The Kalmuks and Ostiaks
represent a more Mongolian stock. The farther
we go to the East the more they resemble the
Yellow race, and the Buriats and Tunguses of
Trans-Baikalia are hardly to be distinguished
from the Chinese.</p>

<p>What tremendous force is dormant in this
world of Tartars! and what a shock their
awakening will cause one day!</p>

<p>Towns like Tomsk, Omsk, Tobolsk, and particularly
Irkutsk, show us the country from
another side. Commercial enterprises, trade, and
general progress, have taken root. They are so-called
centres of civilization, but I fear that they
might more fitly be called places of exploitation.</p>

<p>Certainly these growing towns are not wanting
in praiseworthy attempts at culture, and I
was especially struck by the philanthropic
and charitable institutions. Unfortunately, the
moral tone of this agglomerate population is deplorable,
and money is spent in a reckless way.</p>

<p>Men, banished from their homes to such<span class="pagenum">[xxvii]</span>
distant regions, allow themselves to be dragged
down and brought to contempt, instead of trying
to dominate the mass by superior character.</p>

<p>Manchuria was entirely under Russian rule
in those days. The famous railway was in the
hands of the Cossacks, although it ostensibly
bore the name of the "Eastern Chinese Line,"
and barracks for Muscovite soldiers were dotted
all over the country. The larger towns had
quartered on them Russian officials under
various designations, such as consuls, railway
directors, bank managers, and so forth. Their
influence and domination were uncontested,
although apparently they were on the best of
terms with the local officials. The Russo-Chinese
Bank had branches everywhere, and
evidently the least services rendered them were
amply recompensed. This Asiatic method of
colonization was not wanting in interest to the
observer. Its demoralizing effect was very
sad, and could not fail to bring retribution later
on. For after all, political life, like that of individuals,
has a moral code, by which any criminal
actions are bound to find their punishment.</p>

<p>After crossing the Great Wall and staying in
China proper, I still found the preponderating
Muscovite influence. This was especially the
case in Pekin, where the success of M. Lessar,
Resident Minister, and M. Pocadiloff, Manager
of the Russian Bank, was at its zenith. The<span class="pagenum">[xxviii]</span>
influence of St. Petersburg, which had succeeded
in gaining over Li Hung-Chang, was still in full
swing, and Yung Lu was a not less useful partisan.
He was the man of the moment, and
knew how to secure, even to a greater extent
than his predecessor, the sympathy and favour
of the Empress Dowager.</p>

<p>The Court had only just returned from their
flight. They had scarcely settled down again in
that marvellous Palace which they had expected
never to revisit. In fact, who could ever have
imagined, after all the outrages against Christian
Powers, that those Powers themselves
should have brought back again the very people
against whom they had fought only a few months
before?</p>

<p>The diplomatic talent of the Dowager Empress
must incontestably be of a high order.
She was herself a foreigner&mdash;a simple Manchu
girl. No less remarkable than her achievement
in raising herself step by step to the highest
pinnacle of power is the manner in which she
maintains her position. The way in which she
deals with her own provinces, and plays them off
one against the other, is most skilful. It will
therefore not be astonishing if she sometimes
uses the same methods in foreign difficulties.</p>

<p>The victory of the Western Powers was complete,
and yet, with the exception of Russia,
they did not reap any apparent advantage from<span class="pagenum">[xxix]</span>
it. They could come to no agreement among
themselves as to the partition of the spoil, and
the disappointment of Japan at seeing the territory
she had formerly conquered pass into the
hands of her rivals, was only too justly founded.</p>

<p>The situation was most interesting, the general
tension being extreme. At the same time it
was just this atmosphere of excitement which
rendered my stay so instructive and intercourse
with leading men of such great interest. Every
one gained in importance at this critical moment.</p>

<p>Men like Prince Ching, the Foreign Minister
of China and a near relative of the Emperor;
his interpreter, Mr. Lee, who has such thorough
knowledge of European countries; Yan-Tsi-Kai,
who represents the Chinese military spirit
and believes in introducing Western methods;
and Chang-Tsi-Tung, the great sage and strict
disciple of Confucius&mdash;are fine specimens of
the children of this vast and unknown empire.</p>

<p>After all, among so many interesting points
in the Far East, the most interesting is man.
Situations may change, war and peace, power
and decadence, follow each other at intervals,
but the essential characteristics of this population
will remain in their main tendencies more
or less the same as long as the race endures.
The expressions of national sentiment that surround
us, great and small, whether apparently<span class="pagenum">[xxx]</span>
superficial or really striking, are human documents
which must be considered with earnestness
and attention, for after all it is they, more
than political treatises, diplomatic achievements,
or victories of armies, which will direct the
natural tendencies and the relentless march of
progress in and development of nations in the
future. It is when observing, in all its phases,
the life that surrounds us, that we can gain an
approximate idea of the possibilities of the Far
East.</p>

<p>I arrived in the Land of the Morning Calm,
which might more suitably be called the Land
of Continual Upheaval, when a revolution was
in progress. Y-yung-Ik, Minister of Finance,
was being attacked by those who sympathized
with Japan. The capital was divided into two
camps. Skirmishes took place in the open
street. Everybody was excited, and anarchy
reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Y-yung-Ik, whose views were favoured at the
Palace, and who, on the occasion of the last
riots, had saved the Emperor's life, carrying him
on his back to the Russian Legation, where he
remained for over a year, was in concealment
in the Palace, and the mob was raging vociferously
before the Imperial abode. It was a
typical situation, throwing a strong light on
the condition of the country.</p>

<p>The nation was divided into two factions.<span class="pagenum">[xxxi]</span>
There were pro-Russians and pro-Japanese, but
no pro-Koreans. This fine country, instead of
constituting a guarantee of the peace of the
Far East, was a prey to rivalry. Once suzerain
of China, then under Japanese influence, during
my stay she seemed to be at the mercy of the
Slav.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the last flicker of the candle
of Russian preponderance in the Far East.
Their hegemony was not only apparent at
Court and in the Ministries, but even began to
be established all over the country. As in
Manchuria, so in Korea, Russian soldiers and
sailors, who were billeted on the country for
various reasons, made themselves quite at home.</p>

<p>Between the Russians and Koreans there did
not appear to be the same difference which
separates Europeans from Orientals. The uncultured
children of the Steppes amalgamated
naturally with the native population. It was
striking, particularly in Manchuria, to notice
how the so-called conquerors began to be conquered
in their turn by the land they occupied,
which, indeed, in the long run, has always
absorbed those who dreamed of dominating
her, whether Mongol, Tartar, or Manchu. Probably
what happened to the descendants of the
famous Genghis Khan would have happened
to the victorious Muscovite.</p>

<p>Arms cannot solve problems of a higher<span class="pagenum">[xxxii]</span>
order. In spite of their superiority of military
equipment, the new invaders of the Eastern
Asiatic continent, the new masters of Manchuria,
did not seem to be conscious of their moral duty
towards their lately acquired subjects.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to raise the population
among whom they had settled, to a higher degree
of civilization, and to inculcate nobler ideals,
they were on the point of slipping down to the
level of the so-called conquered barbarians.</p>

<p>The life and the mode of thought of the camps
were low, and the moral dangers of every kind
that surrounded the soldiers and officials were
too great for people who, in many cases,
had only a veneer of culture themselves and
very little practical experience of civilizing and
ennobling work, to struggle against.</p>

<p>After all, a state has only the right to conquer
when, instead of oppressing, they strengthen
and educate those weaker and more primitive
than themselves. Conquest can only bear ripe
fruit when it is for the general welfare.</p>

<p>Nations, like individuals, have their moral
codes, and vocations. Nemesis must always
overtake evil of every kind, and to the virtuous
alone is granted the palm of final victory.</p>

<p class="center "><b>THE TSAR AND TSARINA AT THEIR
HOME OF PETERHOF</b></p>


<p>It is half-past nine in the morning, as I start
on my journey to Peterhof, having been
honoured by the Tsar with an invitation thither.
It is yet cold and chilly. The great metropolis
is covered with a veil of fog. One would imagine
that winter had already begun, and it is difficult
to realize that according to the calendar it is
the month of August. The street leading to the
Baltic station, St. Petersburg, is still half deserted.</p>

<p>There Switzers begin to sweep the doorways,
and detachments of soldiers hurry to take up
their different posts. There are a few milk-carts
that rattle to and fro, and one or two
private vehicles occupied by people in full dress
and uniforms covered with decorations, throwing
into sharp contrast the dreary surroundings
of the humble suburb. In fact, contrasts are
the most striking feature of the capital of the
vast Russian Empire&mdash;contrasts in light and
shadow, splendour and humility, and I dare say
contrasts in everything that is characteristic of<span class="pagenum">[2]</span><a name="index2"></a>
the West and the East.</p>

<p>The railway station, where I arrive at last,
is certainly one of the most interesting illustrations
of what I have just pointed out&mdash;the very
link and meeting-place of the West with the
East. It is crowded with people: their countenances
are so different, their dress so picturesque,
their behaviour so unconventional, yet
so characteristic, that I forget that I am on a
railway platform, and imagine myself amidst
the picturesqueness of a great caravanserai.</p>

<p>Perfect order is kept. The train is already at
the platform, ready to start, and I am shown
without delay into my compartment. There
are a great many officials, all of them in striking
uniforms. In fact, there are nearly as many
railway employés as travellers, and together
they form incoherent groups of Oriental brightness.</p>

<p>The train winds through colourless and uninteresting
suburbs for some time. Here and
there we have a glimpse of the white Neva,
arched by beautiful bridges and skirted with
magnificent palaces. We pass near many small
villages full of summer-houses, all built of wood.
Each house is painted in different colours, and
has its own pretty garden. There are some
red, some green, and some blue, making a polychromatic
mosaic on the green fields. They are
all summer residences of the official or semi-official<span class="pagenum">[3]</span><a name="index3"></a>
world, who are obliged to pass the summer
near town. Indeed, the great charm of
St. Petersburg consists in its neighbourhood.
These attractive retreats, or, as they are called,
<i>Datshas</i>, are on the riverside or on the seashore,
or hidden in a quiet neighbourhood like the
magnificent Imperial residences, Tsarskoe Selo,
Pavlovsk, and Gatschina.</p>

<p>But among them all, Peterhof is the most
famous&mdash;the Versailles of the North. I think
Peterhof undoubtedly deserves the first place.
There is not only splendour, but there is real
beauty too. Art and nature contribute to
make it one of the loveliest spots on earth.
There is, in fact, only one royal residence, I
think, that can compare with it, and that is the
castle of Pena on the high peaks overlooking
the ocean near Lisbon.</p>

<p>To get an idea of Peterhof we must imagine
a luxuriant forest overshadowing the blue
waters of the Baltic. Buried in the woods are
summer-houses, gardens, fountains, Greek temples,
and triumphal arches. The palace itself
stands on a hill that has been cut into terraces&mdash;terraces
that are surrounded by balustrades
and ornamented by statues and flower-vases.
Then as a centre there is a magnificent cascade
looking like a crystal staircase leading up to a
golden palace; it spreads out its waters into a
silver carpet covering the pathway and flowing<span class="pagenum">[4]</span><a name="index4"></a>
in a broad canal to the sea, bordered by an
avenue of rippling fountains.</p>

<p>And when we get tired of the golden palace,
of its silver carpet and its dazzling brightness,
we return to some of the smaller residences, of
which there are many scattered about in the
grounds. Some are little French châteaux,
some others imitate Dutch farms or Roman
villas. They are all different in style and taste,
but they are all charming, and contain priceless
collections of art. Each has interesting annals;
each has some historical connexion and a past
of romantic or tragic memory. Wars have been
declared, treaties ratified, peace re-established
in its lofty halls and gilded salons, every one
the scene of important events. Peter the
Great's many schemes were born within these
walls; and from these groves Catharine II ruled
with her iron sceptre.</p>

<p class="caption">LE PALAIS ANGLAIS<br />"The great charm of Petersburg is its neighbourhood"<br />
[To face page 4]</p></div>

<p>The present Tsar selected for his home one of
the smaller châteaux, called Alexandrovsky.</p>

<p>Alexandrovsky is indeed a modest house.
It has no lofty cupolas, no magnificent gates,
no stately <i>cour d'honneur</i>. It is a simple villa
such as is seen in the neighbourhood of well-to-do
commercial towns. It might be somewhere
near Birmingham or Queenstown. It is built
of bright red bricks, has some friendly bow windows,
and is ornamented by some little turrets.</p>

<p>Its charm consists in its homeliness. Its beauty<span class="pagenum">[5]</span><a name="index5"></a>
is its situation.</p>

<p>It stands in the centre of a green lawn on the
border of the sea. It is surrounded by a little
flower-garden, where, instead of magnificent
fountains and marble statues, there are masses
of bloom full of colour and scent; borders of
lilies, hollyhocks, poppies, and sweet peas form
a natural fence of many hues against the sombre
background of the wood. It is a garden which
you can realize is tended with affection.</p>

<p>The Empress herself takes an interest in it,
and, surrounded by her daughters, passes in this
charming retreat many quiet hours of the long
summer afternoons. Undoubtedly, this must
remind her of lovely Wolfsgarten, hidden in
the Hessian forests, where she passed the merry
days of her childhood, where she returns so
faithfully nearly every year, and where she is
so beloved by all the villagers.</p>

<p>Her Majesty is tall, has a fine presence, and
is extremely graceful in all her movements.
She is refined in the highest degree and very
artistic in her disposition. Her leisure hours
are mainly occupied in drawing, painting, and
music. She is an ardent supporter of all the
artistic societies in the capital, and gives a great
impetus to literary training in all the different
schools which are under her patronage. There
are a large number of these schools in St. Petersburg,
and she pays personal visits to them frequently.<span class="pagenum">[6]</span><a name="index6"></a></p>

<p>Her greatest interest, however, is concentrated
in her children, and she finds her chief happiness
in her own home. Her domestic virtues
are those which make her respected by the
whole nation. Coming as she did from a far-away
country, and being a foreigner, it must
have been no easy matter to be at once understood.
For refined and retiring natures it is
specially difficult to become at once popular.
It is only in time, and by having opportunities
to show deeper qualities, that sympathy can
be awakened. By kind actions, by benevolence
towards those she came in contact with,
and by unbounded charity, the love of the
nation was secured. But how she won the
hearts of all was by being an ideal mother.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_6.jpg" alt="The Empress of Russia" />
<p class="caption"><i>Copyright, Nops Ltd.</i><br />H.I.M. THE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA<br />
[To face page 6]</p></div>

<p>The Empress is a devoted mother. She attends
to her children, as much as possible, personally,
and with the greatest care supervises
the education of her four little daughters.</p>

<p>The nurseries are established entirely on the
English system. There is great simplicity in
the furniture, but plenty of fresh air and a good
water supply.</p>

<p>The nursery governess is an English lady, and
the rules of this little world are strictly observed
and precisely carried out, Her Majesty herself
having been brought up, as a grandchild of
Queen Victoria, on the same principles. Method<span class="pagenum">[7]</span><a name="index7"></a>
and punctuality are strictly observed, and the
little Princesses must attend to their duties
most scrupulously; lessons, recreation, exercises&mdash;everything
is timed and planned in advance.
There is a great deal to be done in the
twenty-four hours, lessons and all sorts of small
duties of many kinds.</p>

<p>The simplicity of everything might serve as
a model to many households.</p>

<p>The food they partake of is of the plainest
kind, healthy, but nothing elaborate, consisting
mainly of porridge, bread and butter, milk and
vegetables, and a little meat or fish. So it is
with their attire; generally they are dressed
in scrupulously neat white cotton, but it
is devoid of all ornament. They pass many
hours of the day on the seashore, and as
they are running about, laughing, building
castles in the sand, or clasping their beloved
mother round the neck, they make a perfect
picture of happiness.</p>

<p>I reach Peterhof at half-past ten by the
special train which daily conveys the Tsar's
guests and visitors. Officials, Court dignitaries,
aides-de-camp, and others of those who are on
duty, have hurried to the large platform, which,
covered with red carpet, presents the appearance
of a reception-hall. There is great animation
at the Peterhof station all the time the
Court is there, as the greater part of the suite
live in town.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span><a name="index8"></a></p>

<p>Before the station is a long row of carriages
belonging to the Imperial household; peculiar-shaped
victorias are there, horsed by enormous
black Orloff stallions with great arching necks
and flowing manes and tails, looking very much
as if they had stepped from one of the pictures
of Wouvermans or Velasquez. Lackeys, with
three-cornered hats, gaiters, and heavy scarlet
coats covered with gold lace, usher each guest
to his vehicle, and each starts in a different
direction to the many palaces and offices. Rattling
over gravelled roadways, I first fully realize
that in a few moments I shall be in the presence
of the mighty Tsar of all the Russias, the ruler
over the greater part of the enormous Asiatic
continent, the autocratic head of millions of
human beings.</p>

<p>My request is a very modest one&mdash;simply permission
to get to my destination in the Far East
through Siberia. There was some difficulty at
the Russian frontier about my further journey,
and I was advised to get the obstacles removed
by His Majesty himself. He very likely knew
that I am only interested in the spiritual and
philanthropic institutions established in the
Far East, my desire being to get through to my
objective as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We drive for quite a quarter of an hour
through woods, and here and there as we pass<span class="pagenum">[9]</span><a name="index9"></a>
by different residences meet sentries marching
up and down. We pass through several gates,
all of them made of plain wooden bars&mdash;they
might almost be in Leicestershire&mdash;each opened
and closed by a Cossack. As we get nearer
there are more sentries, and several times the
password is given by the groom.</p>

<p>Alexandrovsky stands isolated in a quiet
corner of the vast domain. Its home grounds
are surrounded by walls and a kind of palisade.
At last, having passed the last sentry and the
last gate, the carriage stops at the private garden
entrance.</p>

<p>I am received by an officer who shows me
immediately into the palace&mdash;I ought to say
villa. Villa indeed it is in every respect, and the
entrance-hall is so small that it scarcely holds
the few servants who are in attendance. The
staircase is very narrow, too, and winds in
exactly the same way as in small old-fashioned
English houses.</p>

<p>The drawing-room gives the same impression
of comfort and cheerfulness&mdash;the privileges of
English homes. It is small, and with a rather
low ceiling. The furniture is extremely plain.
The few sofas and armchairs are covered with
bright material, and the woodwork is lacquered
white. The walls are covered with watercolours,
sketches, and photographs. In one
corner there stands a piano with music, and in<span class="pagenum">[10]</span><a name="index10"></a>
the window a desk, apparently both much in
use. The main feature of this room is the
quantity of flowers. Tables, brackets, and
furniture, are laden with jars, vases, and bowls
filled with fresh-cut, sweet-smelling flowers.</p>

<p>But I have no time for further observations
or to analyze more minutely this bright, homely
abode in all its detail, giving as it does such a
good insight into the private life of its owners.
Simple, bright, unassuming, it is a sincere illustration
of domestic happiness; and with its
writing-desk littered with papers, its piano
covered with music, and tiny jars and vases full
of sweet-smelling blossoms, it is a human document
in itself.</p>

<p>The door opens and an imposing A.D.C.
enters and announces that His Majesty is ready
to receive me. He is one of the Grand Dukes
on duty at the palace for the day. He is a first
cousin of the Emperor, an officer in the Russian
army, and a most accomplished linguist. He
narrated to me many interesting details of his
yachting tour in far-distant seas. He had just
returned from India, and seemed much impressed
by the beauties of that wonderful land.</p>

<p>A bell begins to ring, a signal that the Emperor
is ready to receive me. I am shown into the
next room, which is even smaller and simpler
than the one which I have just left. In its
extreme modesty the furniture seems to be reduced<span class="pagenum">[11]</span><a name="index11"></a>
to a few chairs, a lounge, and a large
writing-table which occupies the greater part of
the room.</p>

<p>This is His Majesty's study.</p>

<p>But if the interior is so very unassuming, the
view out of the windows is simply magnificent;
it looks straight on to the sea&mdash;a grey and shining
mirror, crowned by the dark battlements of
majestic Kronstadt. The famous citadel floats
like a mirage in the blue haze of the distance,
looking even finer than usual as I see it from
one of the Tsar's windows.</p>

<p>The room is so small that there is no space
to make the obligatory three bows. I have
scarcely stepped into the room when His Majesty
gets up and meets me himself with his well-known
affability. Nicholas II wears the undress
uniform of a Russian general&mdash;dark blue
and green, with a very little gold lace, and a
single medal on his breast&mdash;a modest garment,
subdued in colouring, suited very well in every
respect to its owner.</p>

<p>The portraits of the Emperor are well enough
known to make it unnecessary for me to go into
minute details. He is not tall, and of rather
delicate frame, but healthy, and with a good
complexion. What strikes one at the first
moment is his open and kind-hearted expression.
The two main features that impressed
me at the first glance are the turquoise-blue<span class="pagenum">[12]</span><a name="index12"></a>
colour of his eyes and their open gaze. Those
eyes, which are the chief feature of his countenance,
and seem to be a family inheritance, can
hardly fail to arouse deep sympathy in the
beholder. A very great likeness exists in this
respect to the heir to the English throne.</p>

[To face page 12]</p></div>

<p>His Majesty seemed to be much interested in
my proposed journey across Siberia, and wanted
to know how long I intended to stay in those
regions. He spoke in an interesting way about
his own experiences; he knows the whole length
of the country in fact, as Tsarevitch he turned
the first sod for the railway about twelve years
ago in Vladivostok, and now the line runs from
one end to the other, linking two continents.
But he himself has travelled over the greater
part of the route in the simple Russian <i>tarantas</i>.</p>

<p>He gave me with great vivacity many of his
innumerable reminiscences and impressions. He
was interested in every question, and tried to
see everything as much as possible for himself.
He stopped at each place of any importance
and investigated the situation in detail. Besides
his official engagements, he was keenly interested
in the purely historical and scientific sides
of these unknown regions. The knowledge he
gathered during his journey is unique in value,
and of the greatest importance to students of
the Asiatic races, their origin, life, and future
development. Undoubtedly there has been no<span class="pagenum">[13]</span><a name="index13"></a>
other ruler of this enormous empire who ever
before ventured to enter these remote districts.</p>

<p>He told me what never-failing interest it was
to him to come across the different races in his
Asiatic dominions, and to see the nomadic tribes
there leading their own primitive life. It was
a pleasure to listen, not only to his world-wide
experiences, but to all his different impressions,
gathered with the fresh conception of a young
man, and to realize the keen interest which
every sentence so eloquently expressed.</p>

<p>He spoke with such benevolence about his
subjects, with such love about all those with
whom he came in contact throughout his endless
wanderings, that there should be no doubt
that the Tsar of all the Russias really loves his
subjects tenderly, and that their welfare is the
highest aim of his life.</p>

<p>And he spoke further of his hopes of improving
their condition, of witnessing their advancement,
and of his earnest wish to have peace
during his reign all over his territory. When he
spoke about the great blessing of universal peace
his voice vibrated with an emotion that carried
the conviction, that so long as the fate of his
vast empire depended entirely on his personal
desire, there would be no cruel wars, but calm
peace and prosperity over all his possessions.
In replying I ventured to remark, "What could
prevent the mighty Tsar of all the Russias<span class="pagenum">[14]</span><a name="index14"></a>
carrying out his wishes?" He only answered,
with a never-to-be-forgotten expression, "I see
you are yet a new-comer in this country."</p>

<p>His Majesty showed the greatest care in making
my journey through his vast empire, across
Siberia, not only possible, but also in insuring
that I should see as much as possible&mdash;that I
should be able to observe and learn as much as
would be useful to my endeavour.</p>

<p>His Majesty's permission was extended to
embrace such hospitality as I would not have
sought. I took the liberty of saying I would
prefer to proceed as a humble missionary to my
destination.</p>

<p>His Majesty kindly insisted:</p>

<p>"If you will not accept it for yourself, accept
it for the satisfaction of your mother. She
must be very anxious. I know from my own
travels how hard it is for parents to be separated
from their children by thousands of miles. I
sent a telegram every day, but, even then, I
knew what their sufferings were. It will give
your mother some relief to know that while you
are in this empire you are under my protection...."</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>Time seems to have flown. On my way back
I write with difficulty in my solitary compartment,
by the rays of a single light. My day at
Peterhof has seemed to vanish as a moment,<span class="pagenum">[15]</span><a name="index15"></a>
but it has been so full of interesting incidents
that to look back upon it is as if a month had
been crowded into a day. I have no time to
go into details in my diary, so to be correct I
limit myself to generalities, and if I cannot put
down <i>in extenso</i> all that was of interest&mdash;I might
say of importance&mdash;I want to fix the main outlines
of the picture.</p>



<hr style="width: 40%;" />

<p class="center"><b>TO THE FAR EAST
BY THE TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY</b></p>


<p class="center">I<br />
FROM PETERSBURG TO MANCHURIA</p>

<p>Is it really possible to get to the Far East by
land? Is the Siberian Railway open to
the public? Is it comfortable? Those were
the universal questions that everybody without
exception addressed to me on my arrival. As
for the first: yes, it is possible. With reference
to the second, we must make distinctions.
It is well known that to get through Russia
everybody must be provided with a passport
signed by the local Russian consul. It is different
for priests and other church dignitaries
who do not belong to the Greek denomination;
these require a special permission granted by the
Tsar himself. About comfort! The express
trains are not only comfortable, but luxurious.
In my many travels I do not remember having
seen anything better fitted up, or affording to
the traveller greater facilities for forgetting the
long strain of the journey. The Trans-Siberian
Railway is undoubtedly a marvellous piece of<span class="pagenum">[17]</span><a name="index17"></a>
engineering. It may have defects, and it may
need several alterations, but as a whole it deserves
full admiration. Besides its commercial
and strategical importance, as a mere civilizing
influence it might become incalculable.</p>

<p>Another question which is constantly addressed
to me is: Is not the journey very monotonous?
Is it not a most uninteresting and flat country?
Are not the natives of a very low type? The
answer to these questions depends entirely on
what the wanderer is interested in. If he looks
for variety and excitement, the journey may be
to a certain extent uneventful. For those who
are in search of Swiss scenery and Alpine grandeur,
it may seem flat and colourless. As for
social intercourse and pleasure, naturally, these
cannot be expected. But to anybody who is
interested in land and folk&mdash;I mean those whose
emotions are awakened by the deeper characteristics
of the different countries and their inhabitants&mdash;the
journey across the Asiatic continent
cannot fail to offer a series of continuous revelations.
From a geographical point of view, I
admit it is in part very flat, and sometimes for
days the train pursues its way in an unbroken
line through green pastures or the denseness of
virgin forests. The people one meets at different
hamlets are certainly rough-looking, children
of the Steppes; but it is exactly the untouched
state of those regions, and the originality of their<span class="pagenum">[18]</span><a name="index18"></a>
inhabitants, that render it all of the greatest
value to the student of history and folk-lore.
The land may be hilly or flat; its greatest interests
are not dependent upon its mere external
features, and the attractive points of a race do
not consist purely in the state of its advancement.
They may still be very primitive, living in tents,
wearing skins, leading nomadic lives, unaffected,
and yet give us an insight into their characteristics
and capabilities. When untouched and
unaffected by outside influences, they afford
even better material for psychological observation,
and present us human documents of exceptional
interest in regard to the possibilities
of their future.</p>

<p>But what compensates largely for the lack of
panoramic effects is the vastness of the scenery.
Grand it is in every respect. Undulating steppes
like the wave-beaten ocean; never-ending,
densely wooded regions which seem to extend
without limit. Its chief beauty&mdash;if beauty it
may be called&mdash;is the sentiment. The charm
of these northern regions of Asia vibrates in
their atmosphere. Sentiment and atmosphere!
These are the two features of that strange land
which impressed me most during the endless
hours I looked from the balcony of my railway
car, or when I stopped at one or other of the
various townships; or, again, when I was visiting
some of the native encampments. Among<span class="pagenum">[19]</span><a name="index19"></a>
all I noticed that was new and striking, the most
surprising thing was undoubtedly the "unseen"&mdash;what
one might call the moral or metaphysical
sides; the impression of unseen strength, exuberant
vitality, primeval power, which forces
itself on the traveller indirectly again and again
in endless forms and aspects. We see it in the
soil and in the people. It is equally expressed
in the inanimate and animate nature. We perceive
it in the yet unploughed fields, and we feel
it among the unawakened humanity. It is more
an instinctive sensation than the absolute reality
which gives us revelations as to the future of
this part of the globe.</p>

<p>I proceeded slowly, stopping at every place
of interest, and made a short halt wherever there
was anything that appealed to me. And when
my journey was ended, I regretted it had
been so short, and I was sorry the time was too
limited to permit me to penetrate deeper into
the matter. But I did not fail to put down my
impressions from day to day. I made a short
note of everything that was interesting, new, or
striking, just as it presented itself to me&mdash;just
as I saw it at the moment.</p>

<p>At present, when the general interest towards
the Far East is widening, and people seem to
wish to know a little more about Asiatic nations
and their different races, and when every year
will see more travellers and students trying<span class="pagenum">[20]</span><a name="index20"></a>
to make the link between West and East
stronger, I hope a few extracts from my diary
may strengthen their wish, and help them to
realize and put their intentions into execution.
There are great openings for activity, and scope
for intelligence; and there is a great deal to be
done from commercial, scientific, and humanitarian
points of view, for the benefit of the whole
civilized world and the greater glory of the
Almighty.</p>


<p class="center">II<br />
FROM PETERSBURG TO MOSCOW</p>

<p>The Tsar very kindly consented to all the concessions
necessary to traverse his extensive
empire, and, after my leave-taking, an official
brought me all the requisite papers, which had
been signed by the Minister of Railways. What
an interesting man Prince Chilkoff is! and
such an enthusiast too! He lives literally
in the midst of his locomotives, rails, and
sleepers. I think his favourite abode is the extensive
railway workshops of the metropolis.
Looking at him, you would think he was born
in Chicago; he speaks perfect English, but with
a slight American intonation. He is American
moreover in his keen sense of business and
boundless energy. To hear him talk about the<span class="pagenum">[21]</span><a name="index21"></a>
land, new tracks, almost impracticable tunnels,
and steel bridges crossing the large rivers,
is like a most descriptive geographical lecture;
and when he starts on his favourite theories on
locomotives, boilers, and pumps, one regrets not
knowing more about the mysteries and fascinations
of mechanics.</p>

<p>Prince Chilkoff[1] went through a very thorough
mechanical training, and has been studying the
matter in the United States for many years.
He worked there himself, and got initiated into
all the secrets of railway communication. He
returned finally to his own country, where he
hoped to devote his knowledge and qualifications
to the benefit of his countrymen. But
every post of any importance seemed to be
occupied. I hear he was told there was only
a subordinate vacancy in the mechanical department.
"Give it to me," was his answer, and
he is today Minister of all the Russian State
Railways, and controller of nearly 25,000 miles
of railway and other means of communication.</p>

<p class="footnote">[1] It is needless to add that
since this was written Prince Chilkoff has earned a
world-wide reputation by his management of the railway
transport during the Russo-Japanese war.</p>

<p>His study is a large room in the Ministry of
Railways, which is a country-like residence,
standing in extensive grounds. In the centre
of his famous office are two large tables,
covered, as are also the walls, with books, plans,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span><a name="index22"></a>
and railway charts; and as he kindly explains
the route I shall take, he gets up and
points it out on a geographical map opposite his
writing-table. What an enormous territory this
Asiatic continent is! I look at it with a kind
of amazement and a sort of fear. Shall I really
get across it in a comfortable railway carriage,
as you would go on a trip into the country?
My host seems to divine my thoughts, and with
a smile assures me that from one end to
another the line is entirely under the same central
management, and a telegraph apparatus
from the head office brings him unbroken news
throughout the entire length. "I quite understand
it might seem strange and unusual to
other countries, but you must not forget our
tendencies and our force consist in centralization."
He has made the Siberian journey again
and again, and gives me most valuable information
respecting what to see, and where to stop,
and what is really of interest. It is a grand
work, and, considering the space of time in which
it was achieved, and its extent, it seems nearly
incredible. Including the branch lines, the
Siberian Railway is over ten thousand kilometres
long, and its construction was begun only twelve
years ago. Prince Chilkoff has, moreover, under
his management, 10,400 post offices, and over
100,000 miles of telegraph line.</p>

<p>I leave his house charged with valuable hints<span class="pagenum">[23]</span><a name="index23"></a>
and a packet of letters and recommendations;
and Prince Chilkoff, with a cordial hand-shake,
repeats, "Good luck! and don't forget to let
me know if anything should prove unsatisfactory."</p>

<p>My last day at St. Petersburg is even more
crowded than the rest of the week has been.
Calls of farewell, final preparations, leaving cards
and inscribing my name in visiting-books, occupy
the greater part of it. But this going to and
fro gives me opportunity of seeing it again from
end to end in all its immensity before I leave.
What an extraordinary idea to build a town in
the midst of a marsh! to dig canals where one
cannot build roads, and to be surrounded with
a plain as flat as a table. Peter the Great must
have been very much impressed by Amsterdam!
There are corners in St. Petersburg drenched
and misty as on the borders of the Zuyder Zee.
But if it has reminiscences of quiet, home-like
Holland, again there are brilliant thoroughfares
like a Parisian boulevard. The Nevsky Prospect,
in its bustle and traffic, full of colour and
of life, is unique. Nevsky is the main artery
of the capital&mdash;palaces belonging to the Imperial
family and the grandees, public buildings,
bazaars, workshops, and every edifice you can
think of. And each is of different style, each
of different height, and each is painted in a
different hue of the rainbow. Its main feature&mdash;I<span class="pagenum">[24]</span><a name="index24"></a>
dare say attraction&mdash;is its incoherence.</p>

<p>During this last week the Russian metropolis
presented itself to me from a thousand different
sides, and in how many different lights too!
Trying to remember them all before I depart for
good, I do so with preference for what was
pleasant, instructive, and good. Besides, I do
not come to criticize, I merely come to pass
through, and so I prefer to put down in my
diary what might prove instructive. I fully
understand the great attraction which St. Petersburg
always has for foreigners. I admit it also,
though I should not choose it for my residence
or for my sphere of labour. The polish is perfect,
and of course, if one does not belong to a
country, as a passing visitor one scarcely requires
more. The conditions of life&mdash;at least,
for the well-to-do&mdash;are most agreeable; manners
all that can be desired; refinement exquisite.
I do not think you can come in contact
anywhere with better informed and more richly
equipped people than here. Some of the scientific
institutions, like the Naval Academy and
the Public Library, are quite remarkable; and
the new Polytechnic School&mdash;a regular town in
itself, with its five faculties and its laboratories&mdash;stands
alone. Then the museums and galleries
contain the most celebrated art treasures. The
famous Hermitage, large as it is, can scarcely
hold them all. Antiques, gems, jewels, weapons,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span><a name="index25"></a>
vases, engravings, and pictures, all of the first
order; and I must say they appreciate what
they do possess, and the arrangements of the
museums are excellent. Unquestionably there
is a highly intellectual current, or, if you would
prefer to call it so, undercurrent, which comes
to brilliant manifestations here and there; sometimes
most unexpectedly, amid squalor and
débris.</p>

<p>The huge electric globes cast a cold and glaring
light over the gloomy square in front of the
Moscow station. A dense crowd invades passages,
halls, and waiting-rooms, and, like the
swelling tide, groans, surges, and finally overflows
the platforms. Travelling in Russia has a
different meaning altogether from that which it
possesses elsewhere&mdash;it really means a removal:
a regular déplacement. Then, people seem to
leave for ever: all their belongings appear to
follow them, so enormous and so diverse is their
kit. From simple boxes and knapsacks to
kitchen utensils and even furniture, it embraces
everything one could desire in one's own abode.
And afterwards, when they take leave, their
shaking of hands, embracing, and tears, give
the impression that they never are to meet again.
And this is only the local train, taking me as
far as Moscow. What will it be there, at the
Siberian terminus?</p>

<p>The journey lasts only one night, across the<span class="pagenum">[26]</span><a name="index26"></a>
famous wheat-growing plains, and to-morrow,
in the early hours of the morn, I hope to reach
the ancient capital of the Tsars. I want to
break my journey to see the ancient metropolis
of the mighty rulers, to revisit all the famous
scenes where so many important chapters of
eastern history were once displayed to view.
I want to see again the towering Kremlin, with
its mosaic basilicas and treasure-houses, slumbering
at present in quiet dreams of the past
under their golden domes. And I want to get
prepared and acclimatized to a certain extent
for Siberia; for Moscow belongs altogether to
the other continent; it is really the capital
of Asia.</p>


<p style="text-align: center">III<br />
THROUGH EUROPEAN RUSSIA</p>

<p>The fading disc of the sinking sun disappears
slowly beneath the horizon of the waving corn-fields.
The first day of the journey is over. It
was uneventful, calm, but it has not lacked
interest. We have ploughed through endless
fields of rich land, with a peaceful agricultural
aspect. Here and there a few scattered villages
of dark mud huts, and large white churches.
Sometimes there is a country seat of some landed
gentleman, buildings which remind me very<span class="pagenum">[27]</span><a name="index27"></a>
much of an Indian bungalow. They are very
long and of only one storey high, half hidden by
ancient trees. On the high roads peasants are
just returning in endless streams, with carts and
kettles, from their daily work. However far off
they may have been working, they always return
home for the night, for Russian peasants
seldom live on their farms. The whole picture
speaks of such perfect peace: the slowly moving
and singing workmen, and the little villages
bathed in the afterglow, express such simple
happiness, that I can scarcely realize that some
of those very districts have been the scene of
violence and cruel outrages. It is indeed difficult
to believe the reports of the latest troubles
and dissatisfaction which have burst forth in
the midst of the quietest of mujiks. How
difficult it is to understand the inner feelings of
these quaint folk! Sleepy as they may look,
uncultured, and a couple of centuries behind
the rest of the world, they can yet occasionally
awaken; and when they awake, their passions
burst out like as a stream of lava without restraint.</p>

<p>During the day we stop at many smaller and
larger places, nearly all insignificant, and generally
very far from the station&mdash;sometimes so
far that I can scarcely understand the reason
of our stopping. For miles and miles around
there is no human habitation, and we wonder<span class="pagenum">[28]</span><a name="index28"></a>
by whose hands all those fields are worked.
The most important township seemed to be
Marsanka. It is a typical Russian country town,
with its wooden houses, each surrounded by a
flower-garden, and each garden fenced by lattice-work.
The houses and gates are all painted in
bright colours. A river encloses the entire place
like a loop, and beyond the river are low-lying
hills. The main feature of the place is given by
innumerable windmills, of all sizes and of every
imaginable construction&mdash;all equally conspicuous,
equally high, and equally equipped with
gigantic sails. They all whirl&mdash;they all work
as if they would never stop. I do not think I
ever saw so many windmills within view at one
time; I counted more than a hundred. What
a fertile country it must be, to keep so many
busy!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_28.jpg" alt="Marsanka" />
<p class="caption">MARSANKA<br />After a Water Colour Drawing by the Author<br />
"The main feature of the place is given by innumerable windmills"<br />
[To face page 28]</p></div>

<p>It is night as we arrive at Pienza, and we can
see nothing except the railway station; but,
as I hear, this is the main sight of the place.
A fine building, though constructed of wood.
I must also add that the stations all along the
line are fine and convenient. They are well
kept, a great many have restaurants, abundantly
stocked, with richly laid out tables, and
fair attendance. Prices are high, but this is to
be expected, considering the distance from which
they sometimes procure their provisions. Here
at Pienza I find even luxury. Grapes and<span class="pagenum">[29]</span><a name="index29"></a>
peaches from the Crimea, wine from Germany
and France, and all kinds of American and
English conserves; and, as ornamentation, fine
old French candelabra, derived probably from
some ruined noble's residence.</p>

<p>The station is animated. A great many
officers and a great many officials, all dressed in
uniform. Some are travellers, some have just
come from the town for mere amusement. The
great express has not yet lost its novelty, and
twice a week is the object of universal admiration.
Our train consists of two first-class and
three second-class carriages, a dining-car, luggage-van,
tender, and engine. A long corridor
leads from one end to the other, and affords a
convenient walk for daily exercise. The compartments
are nicely fitted up; the one I occupy,
a so-called saloon, affords me a comfortable
home during the journey. The dining-car
is fitted up in American style; and, as I see,
all the seats are taken from morning till night.
To my fellow-passengers their meals seem to be
their only occupation, for if the train stops, and
there is a restaurant, they alight and commence
each time a fresh meal. Indeed, my fellow-passengers
are great eaters and great talkers;
they seem to speak about everything with the
same ease and unreserve. Especially when they
start on their own countrymen and government,
there is no end to their sarcasm and witty remarks.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span><a name="index30"></a>
To any one liking to hear about the
local conditions, the Siberian journey gives an
exceptional opportunity. People soon become
acquainted, and if so they are delighted to find
somebody to whom to grumble. Before twenty-four
hours had passed I learnt more about the
corn-fields and little villages we skirted; about
Russian agricultural and industrial aspirations;
about agrarian Plehve and M. de Witte's commercial
enterprises than I ever should have
expected.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_30.jpg" alt="Samara" />
<p class="caption">SAMARA<br />"I shall make a short stay at Samara"<br />
[To face page 30]</p></div>

<p>It seems that Russia is at present passing
through a serious crisis which affects everybody,
rich and poor&mdash;especially the latter. The conditions
of the peasantry are often very hard,
though the reports we read are generally exaggerated.
Education and moral training might
do a great deal to lift them out of their stagnant
state, to inspire self-reliance, and awaken sound
ambitions; but this is exactly what appears
to be lacking, and where so much good could
be done. And the people deserve education,
for these Russian peasants, as a whole, are a
fine stock&mdash;strong and healthy, easy to lead,
and not difficult to improve. Even more, they
have generally an unspoilt heart, and are capable
of gratitude. What I hear unanimously
abused is the local administration. If I were to
believe half what I heard about the unworthiness
of the official employés, their untruthfulness and<span class="pagenum">[31]</span><a name="index31"></a>
bribery, it would be bad enough, and would
easily explain the reason of the continuous outbreaks.
The antagonism between the so-called
Progressives and Conservatives is becoming
more intolerant, and strivings for reform on a
smaller or larger scale seem to be universal.
Some are hopeful, some pessimistic; some see
Russia's future secured on the same old patriarchal
and primitive foundations, others believe
in commercial prosperity, trade, and advance.
It is a great problem, and it is equally interesting
to listen to the advocate of one or other
theory. Yet I am afraid that in their sanguine
anticipations they are equally far from what
will prove to be the reality.</p>

<p>All the talk I listen to serves as a description
of, or comment on, the uninterrupted panorama
which unfolds itself without ceasing before us
as we glide swiftly along. It is a kind of prologue
to the epic of this land which we shall
soon leave altogether.</p>

<p>To-morrow we shall cross the Volga by the
famous steel bridge of nearly a mile. I shall
make a short stay at Samara, and shall visit its
well-known orphanages, asylums, and other
charitable establishments which the town is
so proud of; and, somewhat farther towards
the east, the train will wind along the Ural
Mountains to Siberia.</p>


<p class="center ">IV<br /><span class="pagenum">[32]</span><a name="index32"></a>
WESTERN SIBERIA</p>

<p>At half-past nine in the morning we cross the
boundary of the two continents. We are in
Asia. A kind of mysterious feeling impresses
itself on my mind. New sensations infuse themselves
into me. Encouraging hopes awaken,
which I trust will give me endurance to carry
out my work and aims.</p>

<p>Asia! What a field for exploration! What
an unlimited area for higher aspirations! Modest
as our endeavours may be, the result may prove
incalculable in the future. From a commercial,
civilizing, or spiritual point of view, there is an
equally vast field for action.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE VOLGA<br />"The famous steel bridge of nearly a mile"<br />
[To face page 32]</p></div>

<p>Our last day in Europe passed on the Baskir
land&mdash;a high plateau, a severe and cold region,
covered with rich pasture and inhabited by a
semi-nomadic race of the same name. Fine people
they are, of heavy countenance and magnificent
frame; very conservative in their habits, very
clannish in their intimacies, and even today
living from preference in tents. They wear
sheepskins; cover their heads, like Eskimos,
with furs; and, instead of boots, roll round their
feet and legs skins fastened like a classic sandal
with endless straps of leather. They look uncouth,
but picturesque. Their movements are<span class="pagenum">[33]</span><a name="index33"></a>
unquestionably plastic. This race is one of the
finest of the Tartar stock, and I am sorry to
learn that they are slowly dying out.</p>

<p>We stop at different places, and on each
platform there are many Baskirs, men and
women all looking very much alike. They are
bringing from their encampments milk, eggs,
and poultry, to sell. I ask several of them the
prices of their goods, and I am astonished at
the cheapness of the market. The price of meat
per pound amounts to the trifle of five kopecks;
while for twenty roubles one may buy a horse,
and a good one too. The soil is rich, its fertility
is exceptional, and it possesses every quality
for agricultural purposes. The future of the
district is bound to be prosperous, and, what is
more, the climate is most invigorating&mdash;raw and
windy, but withal reminding me very much of
the northern Scottish moors. Even the scenery,
when it becomes a little more hilly, has a certain
likeness to Scotland, and the same charm of
solitude and melancholy. All this district impressed
me very much, both from a geographical
and an ethnological point of view, and by its
magnitude it cannot fail to appeal to our minds.</p>

<p>The famous Ural range, I must simply confess,
did not come up to my expectations. I understand
the beauty of glaciers and snow-clad peaks,
barren as they may be, and I fully appreciate
all the beauty of a vast plain, or the charm of a<span class="pagenum">[34]</span><a name="index34"></a>
sand-covered desert; but the medium&mdash;what
is neither one nor the other, neither handsome
nor grand, but what so many admire and call
"pretty scenery"&mdash;never appeals to me. What
interested me more was the economic possibility
of this long stretch of slopes. The extent
of the treasures of this range is yet unknown,
though there are mines which were flourishing
in the eighteenth century. Suleta's shafts were
sunk in 1757, and are still under the workman's
tools. The mines belong largely to the Crown;
they are partly worked by societies, and some
are private property. The Strogonoffs and
Beloselskys have all made their great wealth in
these mines. Some of them seem to be inexhaustible.
What is more, besides gold, silver, lead,
iron, almost every mineral seems to be contained
in their depths. We met a great many workmen
as we stopped, apparently without any
reason, on our way, winding up endless zigzags
to the top of the mountain. I am rather
astonished that they do not in the least look
like miners. They are neither blackened by
coal-dust or smoke, nor have they the
gloomy expression and sad countenance of
those people who are bound to work and
live underground, deprived of the rays of
the sun for the greater part of their lives.
They look much more like farmers&mdash;people of
bright disposition. I hear the wages are low;<span class="pagenum">[35]</span><a name="index35"></a>
but their needs are small, so that they can easily
procure all that seems necessary to their happiness.
On the top of the mountain there stands
a lofty granite obelisk, with a short but significant
inscription. There are only two words:
on one side "Europe," on the other "Asia."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_34.jpg" alt="Siberian home" />
<p class="caption">SIBERIAN HOME<br />"Very conservative in their habits"<br />
[To face page 34]</p></div>

<p>We are in Western Siberia, in the midst of an
expanse of steppe. It seems to be boundless,
and it has nothing to mark its space. It is like
a sea, with all the suggestiveness of the ocean.
Our train crawls like a black reptile, like a monster
of a fairy tale, breathing its steam and black
smoke against the cloudless sky. What a sky it
is! Pale blue, cold and without a single cloud.
I am afraid I must again contradict the general
opinion of travellers about this corner of the
earth. I have repeatedly heard travellers tell
of the gloom and tediousness of the journey
across it. I cannot agree with either remark.
Instead of gloom, I rather think repose would be
a more appropriate expression to describe its
true character; and tediousness is really a question
of personal disposition.</p>

<p>I again break my journey at several places,
and always find more of interest and more new
material for study than I should have dared to
anticipate. Western Siberia is a marvellous
territory, and it possesses all that is required
to make a country flourishing. I quite understand
the great interest which it arouses, and<span class="pagenum">[36]</span><a name="index36"></a>
it is natural that the country should invest
money lavishly for the furtherance of its progress.
They have built up in a comparatively
short time some important townships. Petropaulovsk,
and especially Omsk, Tobolsk, and
Tomsk, are already well-known centres, provided
with richly endowed public institutions.
The Government maintains some large schools
and colleges, and does everything in its power
to attract new settlers to the uninhabited regions.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_36.jpg" alt="A Siberian Town" />
<p class="caption">A SIBERIAN TOWN<br />
"They have built up in a comparatively short time some important townships"<br />
[To face page 36]</p></div>

<p>The colonization of Siberia is one of the most
important national questions&mdash;to people thousands
and thousands of square miles; to exploit
all its resources; to make a country where there
is now only surface and space. And the Government
knows how to offer attractions. Land is
granted under the most favourable conditions;
there is no taxation for the first three years,
seed is provided on easy terms, and, if required,
agricultural implements and machinery
are sold on the instalment system. The
journey is nearly free, the fare being reduced
to a few kopecks per hundreds of miles.
Petropaulovsk is bound to become one day
the junction of Central Asia, when railway
lines will run to the north along the Obi valley
and south <i>via</i> Atmolinsk, to Tashkend and
Bokhara. All this is well thought out, and
already carefully planned. Its accomplishment<span class="pagenum">[37]</span><a name="index37"></a>
seems to be a mere question of time, and, as
indeed is well known as an historical fact, time
has never seemed to be an obstacle to the
achievement of any aspiration conceived by
Russia.</p>

<p>The long line across the vast desert area is
marked at intervals by smaller or larger railway
stations. For whom, and what for? one might
ask, as there is nothing in sight. No town, no
village, not even one human habitation. But,
we are told, Government will soon build a township.
It already has a name, and some of those
imaginary cities even have a small Greek basilica,
surmounted with glaring green cupolas. Again,
some are partly finished, and their wide streets
are bordered by a few wooden buildings. At
the corners there are commodious shops; on
the open square very likely a school; near it
store-houses for wheat and temporary lodgings
for settlers. It all looks so attractive from the
railway station that I wonder if they do it on
purpose to make it tempting.</p>

<p>Some of these new places do not entirely lack
artistic beauty, and certainly they all have the
same characteristic of appearing very national,
holding firmly to the native taste and following
the Muscovite style of architecture. Everything,
it must be confessed, is in keeping with the
surroundings, and at the same time practical
and adequate to the locality. The new settler<span class="pagenum">[38]</span><a name="index38"></a>
builds a small house of wood, and at the same
time tries to make it look neat by carving it
elaborately if he can, and never fails to paint
the wood in all kinds of bright colours.</p>


<p class="center">V<br />
CENTRAL SIBERIA</p>

<p>From unlimited pastures we pass to endless
forests. For days we are surrounded by magnificent
vegetation, including beautiful trees
of varied hues. There are dark oaks and pale
elms, copper beeches and silver birches, the
colour of which is just turning. The foliage
is fading, and as one pierces through their depths
the leaves shake and rustle and pour down in
golden showers. Beautiful this Siberian woodland
is! Unknown, unpenetrated, striking in
its virgin prime.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_38.jpg" alt="Railway Church Service" />
<p class="caption">RAILWAY CHURCH SERVICE<br />"A rolling Greek basilica"<br />
[To face page 38]</p></div>

<p>The railway cuts through in a straight line
for hundreds of miles, and there is nothing to
be seen on either side but centenarian trees and
feathery ferns. What a field of exploration for
a botanist! What a collection of beautiful
herbs and mosses! What exquisite wild flowers!
The colour of them is so deep and glorious, and
the green of the grass is of the richest shade.
Many of the species are scarcely known yet, and<span class="pagenum">[39]</span><a name="index39"></a>
it is quite astonishing to find, in these far-away
regions, plants belonging to families of quite
different latitudes. If the flora is so surprising,
the fauna is even more so: animals of every
size and of every description, from large bears
to tiny squirrels. There are many kinds of quadrupeds:
wolves, foxes, snow-leopards, wild
goats, martens, sables, ermines, and all the innumerable
members of the feline race. But
what are even more interesting than the animal
nature are the fossils found along the banks of
the rivers and deep in the gloom of the earth.
Some magnificent specimens of antediluvian
skeletons have been excavated, and these are
zealously kept in the museums of St. Petersburg,
Moscow, and Irkutsk. And for the ornithologist
it is a perfect land for research. The birds
and their lives seem to have in Siberia a most
interesting past, and the laws of migration offer
a special field of observation. Some come
from as far as Australia, while others choose for
their winter home New Zealand. The theories
explaining this mystery of nature are rather
conflicting, and scientists have devised various
explanations of these far-distant wanderings.
The butterflies and beetles are unique also; in
fact, it is a world in itself lost in far-away
Siberia.</p>

<p>The long track between Tomsk and Irkutsk
has the reputation of being the dreariest and<span class="pagenum">[40]</span><a name="index40"></a>
the most desolate part of the journey. I did
not expect to find much, which may very likely
be the reason that I was so surprised to come
across towns like Krasnoyark, Kanks, and
Udinsk. The first, especially, is an important
centre for trade and business. Besides wheat
and other cereals, it is the great depot for the
increasing exportation of skins, furs, tallow,
grease, and lately butter. The export of butter
is becoming of the greatest importance in Siberia.
Farming is increasing from day to day, and the
Danes accomplish a great deal in this respect.
The yearly export to Europe, especially to the
English market, is quite astonishing, even more
so when we take into consideration that there
are no winter pastures, and that all the cattle
must be kept on stable food. It is easy to understand
the amount of labour and care it requires,
and yet it must pay, considering the number of
Danish families which come yearly to settle
down in Siberia. For some time Krasnoyark
has been the terminus of the Western Siberian
line, and it derives its present importance
partly from this fact. Udinsk is growing rapidly
too, and is the centre of a vast area. Around
its station I saw an enormous encampment of
small Russian tarantas, or cars, heavily laden
with piles of sacks. Barns near the line were
packed with wheat and corn; and yet these
stores do not seem to remain there long, for all<span class="pagenum">[41]</span><a name="index41"></a>
through the journey we constantly passed
trains loaded with cereals. What will it be when
all of this enormous land, the whole of Siberia,
is under cultivation!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_40.jpg" alt="M. de Plehve" />
<p class="caption">M. DE PLEHVE<br /><i>Photo, Levitsky</i><br /><i>Copyright, Nops Ltd.</i><br />
[To face page 40]</p></div>

<p>It was most interesting to watch all these and
many other features; to realize all that has been
done already since the railway was constructed,
and to conjecture the country in its full development;
for nature seems to have provided it
with everything. I am more and more astonished
to find "dreadful Siberia" in reality as rich as,
or even richer than its neighbour across the sea&mdash;the
beautiful Canada.</p>

<p>Behind the green forest a dark blue wall seems
to fence the plain in towards the south. This is
the Altai range. Its length is six hundred verst,
and its peaks seem to be crushed under the
heavy clouds. On the other side is China. The
Altai district has some of the most beautiful
scenery of the whole globe. It is densely
wooded, and dotted with lakes and watered by
endless streams and rivers, for the largest
streams of Asia flow from there to the Polar Sea.
The mighty Yenisei, Lena, Obi, all have their
sources among this wilderness. The Altai range
was the cradle of the most ancient races, for the
earliest inhabitants of the earth belonged to
the same stock as the Finnish and Turanian,
and prehistorical remains of them are to be
found to this day. Even Herodotus mentions<span class="pagenum">[42]</span><a name="index42"></a>
these early folk. Later on Mongolian hordes
swept over the calm valleys, and the present
populace show visible traces of the extraordinary
mixture of the different races which arose
in or overran this country. What great people
some of them became! What extraordinary
might some of them acquired! With what
striking lines they have filled the pages of history!
And as in those days long gone by, some
of those tribes still preserve their independence
and unlimited freedom. They have even kept
the old name of the highest peak, and call it,
as ever before, Chin-Chan, the golden mountain.</p>

<p>I was roused from my reflections by the clanging
of the railway bell at the Irkutsk station.
At last I had arrived at the largest town, what
people here call the "Paris" of Siberia. Since
yesterday morning I have been travelling in
the territory of the government bearing the
same name, of which it is the administrative
centre. The district of Irkutsk is enormous,
with its five divisions of Nijni-Oudinsk, Balagansk,
Kirinsk, Irkutsk, and Erbolinsk, of which
each is a territory in itself. It extends south
to China, and submerges north into the Arctic
Ocean. Its variety equals its size. Besides
the flat pasture regions, it has mountains towering
up to Alpine elevations. Moonkov-Sarde
is 11,430 feet high. The fertility of the soil is
equalled by the richness of the mines; but this<span class="pagenum">[43]</span><a name="index43"></a>
vast area contains scarcely a million people. The
northern part of it is entirely barren, and hardly
explored at all. The present populace derive
their origin from Mongolian lineage. The most
numerous are the Buriats, Tungus, and Kalmuks,
who lead nomadic lives, and for occupation
rear their herds, hunt, and fish. They are not
yet acquainted with agriculture, and when they
settle by the sides of rivers and fertile districts
they leave the land to be cultivated by the
Slavs, and acquire their tools and requisites by
the simple method of exchange. Their religion
is idolatry. In the south there are a great many
Buddhists, and Mohammedanism appeals especially
to the Tartars.</p>

<p>Of all the strange folk by whom Siberia is
inhabited, general curiosity seems to be most
interested in the convicts, of whom, during the
last century alone, more than one hundred
thousand were sent into exile. Only half of
them ever returned to their homes again&mdash;many
died; and only a small contingent settled down
after the expiration of the punishment. But all
this has often been narrated and described by
famous authors: sometimes in such vivid
colours, depicted in all its gloom, lamented with
sighs of agony, that on visiting some of the
prisons and workhouses I am quite astonished
to find them far above my expectations. Considering
the ordinary condition of a Russian<span class="pagenum">[44]</span><a name="index44"></a>
criminal, the difference between home and
prison is not harder than in any other country.
If the officials and jailers are men with human
sympathies, there is every opportunity of spending
their time in a way which will lead to general
improvement. Where the misery really comes
in is with those who are of a higher culture and
greater refinement, and who are, justly or unjustly,
punished for some uproar, and who suffer
merely for their convictions.</p>

<p>To give an adequate idea of the Irkutsk
station on a foggy and rainy autumn night,
at the hour when the express arrives, is simply
beyond possibility. And to describe the way
of getting from the station to the town is even
more so. To begin with, the railway station
does not look like a station in other parts of
the world at all. Roads or streets cannot be
seen, and a town, in our acceptation of the
word, does not exist. The words seem to
change and to lose their meanings there. If
it had been light I should have tried to take
some pictures of the desolation; but it is pitch
dark, so I will confine myself for the moment
to putting down a few notes&mdash;my first impressions.</p>

<p>The train stops with a sudden jerk. The door
of my compartment is torn open with violence,
some brigand-looking men jump in, and as
suddenly as they came disappear again, but<span class="pagenum">[45]</span><a name="index45"></a>
alas! with all my luggage. How long it took
to gather and regain it altogether, I do not remember;
and the extent of my walks from
one end of the long platforms to the other I
cannot calculate. On the chilly platform of
Irkutsk station all ideas of time and space vanish
completely. I think I should be seeking to the
present hour if a martial-looking officer had not
come to my help. His height is imposing, his
gestures commanding, and his voice resounding.
He uses all his enviable qualities at once, and
all for the same purpose&mdash;to find my kit. He
fights his way to achieve this by cutting through
ground heavily barricaded by cases, sacks,
travelling-bags, and furniture. He makes people
stand up and clear out of his way, scolds and
threatens all the porters and every mujik he
comes across. And, strange as it seems to me,
his efforts are crowned with success. He
hands me over all my belongings! I thank him
heartily for his kindness and express my sincere
hope that, owing to his great strategical abilities,
I may find him, if ever I return to Siberia,
promoted to the rank of general. At the same
time I cannot omit remarking that the general
civility and kindness which were shown to me,
by employés and passengers alike, were most
gratifying. Everybody seemed to wish to help,
to give information, and offer whatever they
possessed. Their manners, from the highest to<span class="pagenum">[46]</span><a name="index46"></a>
the lowest, were irreproachable. I will go further,
and say that on no railway have I ever
met guards showing more attention and more
good-nature. And much patience they require.
The electric bells of the different compartments
seemed to tinkle incessantly, as if the only occupation
of some of the travellers was to ask
what they already know, and to order what
they do not require.</p>

<p>Whips crack, horses neigh, coachmen yell,
travellers scream, porters quarrel. Such is the
scene which awaits me in front of the station.
I secure one of the many small droshkies, of
which there are hundreds, and all shaky and
open like the public vehicles of sunny Naples.
The only difference is that instead of sunbeams
there is sleet falling on us from above. My
belongings are put on another droshky, skilfully
fitted together like an elaborate mosaic. We
start in a sea of mud&mdash;dark and liquid as a
sauce&mdash;which covers everything like a shiny
varnish. The depths beneath must be great,
for sometimes my droshky is nearly submerged,
and the lava-like stream floods our small vehicle.
But it seems to be built for use on land or on
water, for sometimes I have a sensation of
floating in a canoe, rather than rolling along on
wheels. We reach terra firma in the shape of a
bridge formed of logs, nailed and tied together.
The bridge is long, but at last, on coming to the<span class="pagenum">[47]</span><a name="index47"></a>
end of it, the driver announces with pride, "We
are at Irkutsk." I cannot help asking, "Where?"
for I do not see any buildings or any sign of a
town. It takes some time before I can distinguish
in the depths of the night high palisades,
looking very much like those surrounding soldiers'
encampments in the Middle Ages. Above
the palisades a few roofs emerge, low and sloping,
very much like a tent. But at a sharp turn a
brilliant electric globe spreads its beams, like
those of a lighthouse at sea, to lead the wanderer
to a secure harbour. Following its course, we
land at the doorway of the famous Hôtel du
Métropole.</p>

<p>For famous it is! I shall certainly not forget
it, and hope never to see it again, for I think
it contains all that Western bad taste and
Eastern filth combined can produce. Along a
passage carpeted with red Brussels and mud a
waiter, in evening dress, but apparently without
linen, shows me to an apartment furnished with
green plush, but devoid of bedding. I am told
that travellers are expected to bring their own
sheets and blankets. I have none, and after
some rushing about I am provided with sheets
which I prefer not to use, and would rather content
myself for my night's rest with an easy
chair and some travelling-rugs. There is, moreover,
no washstand, for the queer apparatus in
the corner, bearing, apparently as an ornament,<span class="pagenum">[48]</span><a name="index48"></a>
only one basin about the size of a finger-bowl,
cannot be so described. No hot water! And
if you call for any they bring a few drops in
a cream-jug. Finally, there is no air either!
The windows are nailed up all the year through.
On trying to open one it nearly fell to pieces.
So if people nowadays ask me what hotels in
Siberian towns are like, I am bound to say you
have plush and gold, but no fresh air and no
hot water!</p>

<p class="caption">IRKUTSK<br />"As I walk down to the Angara's banks I am short of adjectives"<br />
[To face page 48]</p></div>

<p>How shall I record all the tumultuous impressions
of the first twenty-four hours passed
in Irkutsk? After the gloom of the night a
brilliant morning broke forth, brilliant as it is
only seen on these high plateaux. As I took my
first glance round, everything seemed to swim in
a blaze of light. The small log houses seemed to
have grown into palaces. The palisades presented
colours of hundreds of different shades.
Monuments and gilded domes seemed to have
arisen out of the ground. All the gloomy picture
of last night vanished altogether, dispersed
by the light of the sun like the melting away
of a nightmare. What a magician this celestial
body is! Painter, sculptor, and architect, he
can construct and raise marvels out of nothing,<span class="pagenum">[49]</span><a name="index49"></a>
and make us see and admire where all is only
glamour.</p>

<p>As I walk down to the Angara's banks I am
short of adjectives. Language fails to describe
the pureness of the atmosphere, the variety of
the tints of the distant mists, and the whole
scenery of the plain with its vibrating mirages.
I think it is at the early hours of the morn and
at sunset that one can best realize the charm of
this strange country, understand the dreamy
legends which were born on the soil, realize the
soul of its people, and penetrate into its wondrous
atmosphere, full of enigmas and mysteries.</p>

<p>Irkutsk is a large and important centre, the
seat of the military and civil governors, of the
Catholic bishop, of the commander of the forces.
There are high schools, many public institutions,
and factories. Irkutsk is a famous commercial
town, and is one of the most prominent markets
for international trade. The high street is an
endless row of shops, full of goods made in Germany,
and some in America. I do not see much
English merchandise; but, as I hear, English
commercial interests are only represented in a
few of the larger mines and building enterprises.
The Siberian national museum deserves special
mention. It is a fine stone building, rich in all
that relates to the origin, history, and folk-lore
of Siberia. A few hours passed in its halls<span class="pagenum">[50]</span><a name="index50"></a>
give one a most extensive insight into the conditions
of the different races and tribes which
have peopled these regions for centuries.</p>

<p>Irkutsk from a social standpoint seems to
offer some advantages too. Government employés,
officers, and others regard it as a special
favour to get an appointment here. There is
a great deal of entertainment, and in the centre
of the town is a most pretentious building&mdash;the
Imperial Opera House. Life is expensive, and
the population shows a great tendency to luxury,
and even more, what one might call waste. Money
is spent easily and uselessly, as is generally the
case in growing places and recent settlements.
In this respect there is a slight resemblance
between Irkutsk and a Western American ranch
or an Australian mining town; and in the afternoon,
when everybody promenades on the
wooden pavements, which run like bridges across
and along the muddy streets, the inhabitants
show exactly the same variety of origin and of
social condition as in those towns beyond the seas.</p>

<p>Besides Russian, I hear German spoken.
Poles are numerous too, and all the different
Baltic provinces have a fair number of representatives.
Nearly all the trade is in their
hands. Russians are not commercial people as
a rule. And there is a large Chinese colony,
mostly occupied with the famous overland tea
trade <i>via</i> Kiahta. They walk for hours and<span class="pagenum">[51]</span><a name="index51"></a>
hours up and down all these endless pathways,
and a great many sit, covered with furs, in front
of their house doors to see the show. About
eight o'clock everything becomes quiet; streets
are deserted, doors are closed, shutters fastened,
lights extinguished; and there are only the
watchmen sauntering slowly from corner to
corner, monotonously tapping their wooden
rattles to let householders know that they are
awake, and to give the robber at the other side
of the street time to escape.</p>

<p>It is worth while! I should, after all, recommend
travellers to stop for a few days in some
of the largest Siberian towns, in spite of the
rough hotels and the primitive ways; it gives
such a definite idea of their buildings, inhabitants,
and mode of living, as could never be
procured from books.</p>


<p class="center ">VII<br />
TRANS-BAIKALIA</p>

<p>I have arrived at the climax of the journey.
We are crossing Lake Baikal. It is the most
celebrated passage of the whole overland journey;
the scenery is fine: an extensive sheet
of water, brilliant like a mirror, surrounded by
high mountains and majestic rocks; but I am
inclined to repeat what I said before about hilly<span class="pagenum">[52]</span><a name="index52"></a>
scenery: lake districts do not appeal to me.
A sea in its greatness, and a marsh in its diverse
variations of colour, are both perfect in their
artistic values, only different in conception.
The former imposing, like a picture of Meesdag;
the latter, hazy like a Corot, each perfect in its
style. But a lake, even the prettiest, does not
rise above the effects of a chromo-lithograph.
Lake Baikal, viewed from the north, loses its
banks, and so has the advantage of appearing
as an ocean.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_52.jpg" alt="Lake Baikal" />
<p class="caption">LAKE BAIKAL<br />"There are some enormous rocks as if thrown in by the hand of a Titan<br />
[To face page 52]</p></div>

<p>The whole distance is flat, veiled in silver mists
and pierced through here and there by the crystal
peaks of the distant mountains. There are a few
islands scattered about, some enormous rocks, as
if thrown in by the hand of a Titan. To each a
legend is attached. Each has a different fairytale.
All of them, I am told, were inhabited
by dwarfs and fairies, possessed of marvellous
gifts, and belonging to a wondrous past. At
least the mythical minds of these archaic people
endowed each striking spot with a different tale,
and there are many such, especially on the
south-eastern shore, which displays a great
variety of scenery, and this proves to be a serious
hindrance to the completion of the railway
track. The line around Lake Baikal is not
completed yet, for there are several tunnels still
to be bored and a great many rocks to be cut
through; but it is, after all, the only portion of<span class="pagenum">[53]</span><a name="index53"></a>
the track which offers any serious difficulty to
the engineer. All the rest has been easy to accomplish,
and, with the exception of building
the great railway bridges, consisted mainly of
simply laying the rails on level ground. But although
it was not difficult to construct, it might
have been better done. The rails are altogether
too light, and after a few years of traffic working
it is already under constant repair, and will have
to be altered altogether very soon, as it is so
defectively ballasted.</p>

<p>At present the train is carried across the
lake by a huge vessel built in Newcastle. In
winter they sometimes use an ice-breaker, which
apparently works very slowly, for generally
the railway provides, for passengers and
goods, sledges on which to traverse the frozen
waters.</p>

<p>Our boat is overcrowded. Passengers of all
nations and of all grades. Besides Russian
officials, there are foreign tradesmen, a few
Germans, one American, and a Dane, a detachment
of soldiers guarding convicts, and a few
settlers. And so I have an opportunity of
watching the four leading classes of this new
country. These are, indeed, the four different
elements by which Siberia is becoming populated.
I am rather impressed by the perfect cordiality
with which they share the common fate in their
new home. The soldiers are Cossacks, a kind<span class="pagenum">[54]</span><a name="index54"></a>
of irregular troops, and enjoy perfect freedom.
The Government gives them a certain territory,
where they go in for agriculture and raise cattle
and horses, and at the same time are liable for
some military service. They are fine men,
excellent soldiers, and deserve their long-established
fame for courage. The settlers are all
of a different race, coming mostly from central
and southern Russia. They are indifferent-looking,
miserably clad, poor folk, with sallow
faces and sad eyes. Whole families&mdash;fathers
and mothers, grandparents and grandchildren&mdash;have
all gone together to the far-away promised
land to live and to die.</p>

<p>The Russian Government is very anxious to
settle agriculturists in these Eastern Siberian
regions, for the land is as yet barely cultivated
at all. Farmers are very scarce, and the famous
mines are also short of labourers. It seems that
possibilities here are even greater than in
Western Siberia, the only drawback being the
enormous distance. Yet the journey scarcely
costs anything, as I mentioned before; the fare
is merely a nominal sum. It is evident that
Russian railways can afford to lose; their deficits
last year amounted to the sum of fourteen
million roubles. But the main object of these
State railways is not to make money&mdash;anyhow,
not at present. They are designed to colonize
this newly-acquired country, and settle Slavs<span class="pagenum">[55]</span><a name="index55"></a>
among the native Mongolian and Tartar
tribes. And besides&mdash;and I think before and
above all&mdash;there are the strategical interests to
be considered. Undoubtedly the Siberian Railway
is a military one, and with all its junctions
and crossings seems to have been planned with
the view to forwarding troops and ammunition
speedily. And even the often-discussed puzzle&mdash;why
does the Siberian Railway so very frequently
avoid entering the most important
townships?&mdash;might be partly explained from a
military standpoint. Opinions differ as to
whether the railway in its present state can prove
entirely satisfactory for the conveyance of large
army corps. At the same time, we must not
forget that it is partly under construction still,
and its final completion seems to be far in the
future.</p>

<p>The crossing of Lake Baikal takes between
four and five hours. The passage is extremely
rough, and squalls burst forth very unexpectedly.
We arrived about sunset on the eastern shore,
at a place called Myssowa, where there are a
few log houses scattered about, and a rough
railway station; but in the dining-room there
is a table laid out in a lavish style, and, like the
smallest of them on the line, it does not lack its
pride&mdash;a gilt centre-piece and five-armed candelabra.
We do not start again until midnight,
so I have time to go for a walk, though soon<span class="pagenum">[56]</span><a name="index56"></a>
return from it, for it is very dreary. There
are but few buildings, and I am afraid every one
is a public-house, for Myssowa, being the centre
of a rich mining district, shows all the sad sides
of the miners' life. The money they earn during
a hard day's work is thrown away in the hours
of the night. In the front of the station are
a few dozen of them standing about; dismal and
stolid-looking creatures, emerged from the slums
of Western towns and launched in Eastern
Siberia. In these far-away regions, workmen
are rather well paid, and that is the reason so
many remain for some time in the course of
their flight.</p>

<p>It is snowing hard. The feathery flakes fly
and skim like so many white-winged butterflies
against the pale grey sky. It is bitterly cold,
and the windows of my railway carriage are
thickly frozen over, and when they clear there
is not much to be seen. The high mountains
have disappeared, and there is no majestic plain
before us. The whole district is hilly, with here
and there a river, and very scant vegetation.
Villages seem to be unknown, and the first place
of any importance we stop at is Petrovsk, a
locality which owes its origin to its deep mines,
enormous factories, and a large prison to furnish
the workmen. What a gloomy site! Never
have I seen factories and forges more desolate,
and never has smoke appeared heavier and<span class="pagenum">[57]</span><a name="index57"></a>
blacker to me than that which I see puffing
from the numberless chimneys. It is an inferno,
whose horrors only the genius of a Dante could
describe. And if Petrovsk had a city gate, its
sole inscription could be "Lasciate ogni speranza
voi ch' entrate."</p>

<p>And how many have entered this ghastly
place! How many of the Russian and Polish
nobles have been exiled here! Nariskins,
Mouravievs, Anenkoffs, Volkonskys, Troubetzkois&mdash;we
find descendants of all. How many
historical families have had their political aspirations
stranded here! The miseries of Omsk have
been described by Dostoievsky, but those of
Petrovsk will never be entirely known. Many
of the exiles have been followed by their brave
wives, ladies of marvellous courage, leaving
palaces to follow their husbands and to suffer
voluntary exile.</p>

<p>Through the frozen lands of Trans-Baikalia
we continue our way. I am told the country is
very rich. There are over thirty mines in work
at present, and there might be a great many
more. Where they have already started farming
it has proved a great success, and some of
the towns show signs of rising commercial
activity; but I know not why this part of
Siberia misses altogether the great charm, in
admiration of which I was lost a few days ago.
The high plateau of the Baskirs, the steppes of<span class="pagenum">[58]</span><a name="index58"></a>
the Kirghiz, and the dense forests of the Kalmuks,
all had a peculiar charm and atmosphere;
but Trans-Baikalia, though undoubtedly possessing
great economic possibilities, seems to have
no beauty at all. The inhabitants are Buriats,
and nomads, like the others, but lack their
sympathetic features, and seem so strange&mdash;so
entirely different. Their yellow, parchment-like
skins and beady eyes lack all expression,
or if they have any, it is so incomprehensible
to us that we look at them as mere curiosities&mdash;as
children belonging to another planet.</p>

<p>They live in tents or in huts covered with
a kind of felt prepared from horsehair and
furnished with skins; and breed horses, of
which they possess large studs of their own.
Men and women are famous riders, and live in
saddles from the cradle to the grave. Men and
women wear very much the same kind of garments,
heavy boots and low felt hats, and leave
their long hair hanging in greasy tresses. They
resemble the Chinese very much, and even more
so the Tibetans and Bhutanese, and profess the
same religion too&mdash;for nearly all are Buddhists.
Hundreds of Lamas swarm all over the country,
and there are several monasteries belonging to
them. The Government, which is generally hostile
to any creed except the Greek Church, not only
tolerates, but apparently supports their claims to
a certain extent. Russia seems of late to be<span class="pagenum">[59]</span><a name="index59"></a>
taking a great interest in its Buddhist subjects,
of whom it possesses several hundred thousands.
It even accords them every facility to make
their great pilgrimages to the Lama of Lhassa,
in mysterious Tibet, and by this means gets into
constant communication with the forbidden land.</p>

<p>The last day of our journey is passed in the
Amur region; that enormous district, which
was granted to Russia without the drawing of
a sword and without any cost, by a single stroke
of the pen of Count Muraviev after the Treaty
of Pekin in 1860. From Chitta the line turns
to the south-east, and we are proceeding to the
so-called Chinese frontier. At midnight we
reach our destination, a settlement called Manchury,
lost in a corner of the desert of Gobi.
On the other side extends Manchuria, which I
am emphatically assured belongs to the Yellow
Empire. From here the railway runs under a
different title. Instead of being the "Russian
State," it is called the "Eastern Chinese Railway
Company." It has three main branches.
One runs from Siberia to Harbin, the second
from Harbin to Vladivostok, the third from
Harbin to Port Arthur. They unite the Yellow
with the Black Sea through Moscow, and the
Pacific with the Baltic through St. Petersburg.
What may have appeared to be a dream only
a few years ago is a reality today.</p>

<p>A saloon car containing a bedroom, study<span class="pagenum">[60]</span><a name="index60"></a>
with verandah, servant's quarters, and a kitchen,
which the Company very kindly put at my
disposal, and which is to serve as my home
while getting as far as Niu-chwang and Port
Arthur, is now being attached to the new train,
and while it is being got ready I have time to
sum up recollections and arrange my papers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_60.jpg" alt="The Station of Manchury" />
<p class="caption">THE STATION OF MANCHURY<br />"Lost in a corner of the desert of Gobi"<br />
[To face page 60]</p></div>

<p>There is more to note than I expected, for I
found interest in every direction and in every
respect. Siberia is more than a country, it is
a continent&mdash;I might even say a world of its
own. It has its characteristics and special
features; its own soil and its own folk; its own
geography, ethnography, and climate. It is an
unknown land altogether; new or old, as you
like to call it. To understand it requires more
instinct than erudition, more sympathy than
analysis. The observer must have sentiment;
and even so it may or may not appeal to him,
and he may like it or not, yet he cannot fail to
regard it as impressive and imposing. It is a
land of nearly five million square miles, and it
has eight organized provinces, of which each is
larger than most of the Western kingdoms. It can
be maintained and developed from its unlimited
resources, and guarded by an army amounting,
if required, to millions. It is grand in every
respect. It is watered by the largest streams
of Asia, and possesses the most extensive fresh-water
lake of one hemisphere. It has a greater<span class="pagenum">[61]</span><a name="index61"></a>
area of productive land than all Europe put
together; its forests are hardly measurable;
its mountains tower high to the sky; its reputed
monotony should rather be called vastness, for
variety it does not lack, only it occurs at enormous
intervals.</p>

<p>The same distinctions prevail with regard
to the inhabitants; they belong to various
tribes and descend from different races. Some
belong to the Tartar, some to the Mongolian,
some to the Caucasian family. Some are
yellow, and some are white. To-day the rulers
are the latter, but it is the home of the former.
Will the white remain the dominating race, or
will it be overwhelmed by the yellow, or will
it become amalgamated and swallowed up by
the great majority? What an interesting problem,
and how inexplicable! It is, indeed, hard
to understand the nature of these people; to
read their thoughts; to comprehend their lives;
and to realize their ideals.</p>

<p>Once mighty, now in decay; leading a
subordinate, unorganized existence, lacking
energy, unfit for higher aspirations. And yet
physically all these nomads are fine creatures,
possessing all the power of their forefathers
of the time of Genghis Khan. How long will
it take them to awaken? How long will it
require to realize and acquire all the advantages
of Western civilization and the elevating power<span class="pagenum">[62]</span><a name="index62"></a>
of Christianity?</p>

<p>These are questions which can only be answered
by the history of the future. The best
forecast, I am afraid, will fall short of what will
prove to be the reality. I fear there may yet
be many wars, and I hope peace too, and conferences
and treaties; but racial struggles cannot
be settled on battle-fields or in houses of
parliament. The destiny of mankind has a
higher tribunal.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the future of the Far East,
the Siberian Railway will have undoubtedly
a certain share, if not by altering, certainly by
hastening its course.</p>

<p>It was a mighty step forward. The step of
a Colossus!</p>

<p class="center "><b>MANCHURIA UNDER RUSSIAN RULE</b></p>


<p>Am I on Chinese territory? Does Manchuria
really belong to the Yellow Empire? Since
I crossed the Russian frontier several days ago
there has not been the slightest change that I
could see. Everything has remained Russian.</p>

<p>Our train was in charge of Muscovite soldiers,
the railway officials at the stopping places were
Russian officers, the barracks around were inhabited
by Cossacks. The line was guarded by
Russian troops, and if the latest reports could
be trusted, public safety seemed far from secured.
Hardly a day passed without atrocities of some
kind being reported, and skirmishes between
Manchu marauders and Russian scouts were of
frequent occurrence. The railway itself was
constantly threatened, the banks destroyed, and
the rails torn up; so even our train was provided
with a military escort to defend it in case
of necessity.</p>

<p>The "Eastern Chinese Railway Company,"
so called in order that there might be something
Chinese at all events about the name, is
an exclusively Russian enterprise, and no one<span class="pagenum">[64]</span><a name="index64"></a>
disputes its entirely strategic object, which is
to connect Vladivostok and Port Arthur with
Moscow and St. Petersburg. This became very
evident to me during my journey. The line is
constructed by Russian troops and military
engineers under the direction of officers. It is
still far from complete, and I was therefore the
better able to watch the progress of this interesting
undertaking. The work is carried on at
great speed&mdash;thousands of coolies are employed
upon it under the supervision of Cossacks. The
sand is moved in wheelbarrows, sleepers are laid
and rails fixed, all at one and the same time, by
different gangs of workmen. The system of
construction is the same as that so successfully
adopted by General Annenkoff for the Trans-Caspian
Railway.</p>

<p>I had plenty of time to give my full attention
to it, for there was nothing else to see. We were
crossing the north-eastern border of the Gobi
desert, and if ever desert was rightly so named,
it is this one. The Sahara has at least the charm
of the tropics, the Arabian desert has the beauty
of a cloudless sky, the desert of Bikanir possesses
the golden hues of the Indian sun; but the
Gobi desert has nothing to commend it; it is
absolutely desolate. There is neither colour
nor charm, but a leaden sky hangs over an endless
expanse of grey dust&mdash;or rather, ashes&mdash;which,
when whirled about in the wind, obscures<span class="pagenum">[65]</span><a name="index65"></a>
heaven and earth and covers everything as with
a shroud. Not a village was in sight, not even
a solitary dwelling. The only living creatures
in this desolate region seemed to be the Russian
troops and the legions of coolies working under
their orders.</p>

<p>Before going any further I must explain that
I was travelling by goods train. The line, as
already said, was not finished, the rails hardly
laid, and there were no proper stations; guards
and officials being accommodated in temporary
huts and encampments. There was no regular
tariff and no tickets were issued. Trains of
trucks with materials for construction plied
between the main junctions, and these same
trains also conveyed the workmen and the
persons connected with the undertaking, to
their various destinations.</p>

<p>It was necessary to get a special permission
from the authorities to travel by this route.
Of course I was prepared to rough it, and the
directors had not disguised from me the fact
that as yet no arrangements had been made
for the convenience of passengers. They could
not even promise that I should reach Port
Arthur without delay, for some of the temporary
bridges had been destroyed by the autumn rains,
and the railway banks in various parts were
washed away by the floods. But a special car
was placed at my disposal for the whole journey<span class="pagenum">[66]</span><a name="index66"></a>
across Manchuria, and this semi-saloon car became
my domicile for several weeks.</p>

<p>To give some idea of my movable house, I
may say that although the exterior was extremely
simple, the interior was comfortable enough.
It consisted of a bedroom, a study, a passage,
a lavatory, and a small balcony; besides these,
there were a kitchen and sleeping accommodation
for my servant. The balcony was my
favourite resort: many a peaceful hour have I
spent there in reading or writing, and looking
out upon that dismal landscape unfolding itself
in its monstrous immensity.</p>

<p>Sometimes my home was shunted and I was
left for days to amuse myself in the vicinity of
some place of interest. Then it would be hooked
on again behind trucks carrying bricks, iron,
and all kinds of machinery. My carriage was
my home, my stronghold. And indeed it was
not unlike a fortified castle when it stood motionless
near one of the stations, with sentries
and watches patrolling round or halting in the
neighbouring encampment. I was never quite
sure whether they regarded me as a convict or
whether they kept a kindly watch over me.</p>

<p>Along the route various stations were in
process of building, some already roofed. Unpretentious
structures they were, never more
than one storey high, and roofed with black
tiles. Outwardly they resemble the Chinese<span class="pagenum">[67]</span><a name="index67"></a>
houses, and the beams are curved in the
"Ting" style. Although unfinished, they impress
one as if encumbered with a weary past,
rather than as having a bright future in store.</p>

<p>Everything, in fact, has a doleful aspect here.
There are no gardens and no cultivation of any
kind worth mentioning. The station yards are
swamps, or pools of mud. Here and there an
attempt has been made to improve matters,
and stones or planks are laid down at intervals
to assist the traveller in crossing.</p>

<p>Refreshment rooms are liberally provided on
the Trans-Siberian line, and occasionally they
even have some pretence to luxury; but in
Manchuria they are of the most primitive description,
scarcely provided with the barest
necessities. A wooden table and a rough bench
are the usual accommodation, and the cabbage
soup or the national <i>kasha</i> made of buck-wheat
is served by an amateur cook with all the air of
a novice in the profession. At the junctions,
where trade is somewhat brisker, one is able to
get <i>piroshki</i>, which means, as it is, one of the
favourite Russian dishes.</p>

<p>Primitive as the refreshment places are&mdash;a
bare tent sometimes serving the double purpose
of kitchen and dining-room, with an old kerosene-oil
case for table and dresser&mdash;they are
always much frequented. On the same principle
as that adopted for the construction of the railway,<span class="pagenum">[68]</span><a name="index68"></a>
the Russian "chefs" make the Chinese
coolies do all the work.</p>

<p>Travelling through Manchuria in this leisurely
manner, I had plenty of time to obtain a thorough
acquaintance with its different regions. From
a geographical point of view the northern portion
consists of a barren tableland; towards
the south it becomes wooded, and in the vicinity
of the towns the ground is fairly well cultivated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_68.jpg" alt="Tsi-tsi-kar" />
<p class="caption">TSI-TSI-KAR<br />"The capital of Northern Manchuria is Tsi-tsi-kar"<br />
[To face page 68]</p></div>

<p>The capital of Northern Manchuria is Tsi-tsi-kar.
The Governor of the province resides there,
and it is the centre of that part of the country.
But the town itself is very primitive, and far
behind the other two chief towns, Kirin and
Mukden. The population is a mixture of Manchus,
Chinese, and Buriats, who do a small
trade in raw materials, more especially in skins
of all sorts.</p>

<p>From a very early date caravans have made
this place one of their stopping stations on their
way from the southern provinces to the districts
north of the Amur. The people still use the
same primitive carts as in those remote times,
sometimes drawn by Mongolian ponies&mdash;I have
seen as many as sixteen or eighteen to one cart&mdash;more
often by oxen.</p>

<p>The peculiar way in which the harness was
fixed always amused me: it seemed an inextricable
confusion of straps and cords. How do
they manage it? It is a problem which only<span class="pagenum">[69]</span><a name="index69"></a>
Chinese patience can solve.</p>


<p>I had equally good opportunities of studying
the local dress and the customs of the natives.
In this vast, barren region, where no European
had ever penetrated before the construction of
the railway, everything is still in its primitive
state. The people live partly by agriculture,
such as it is, and partly by fishing. The houses
are extremely poor; we should call them hovels,
built of bricks or dried mud. There they live,
together with their cattle and other domestic
animals. Like all Asiatics, they are devoted
to horse-breeding, and I visited several large
<i>haras</i>.</p>

<p>Flocks and herds abound, but the animal one
meets with most frequently is the pig; but the
pigs of this region are very different from ours.
They are usually black, with long, thin tails,
looking rather like boars. Numbers of them are
to be seen in every yard, rooting up the ground
and giving the Manchu homestead about as
untidy and dirty an appearance as is possible
to conceive.</p>

<p>Of poultry there is no lack either. Geese,
ducks, and fowls share the family abode. The
entrance to every house is guarded by half-savage
dogs, like so many wolves, and certainly
not less ferocious. More than once I was nearly
devoured by them, and as it is not advisable to
fight them I always took care to have my pockets<span class="pagenum">[70]</span><a name="index70"></a>
full of biscuits.</p>

<p>A Manchu home, in short, has the appearance
of a cattle show, or a Noah's ark, and the life
lived is unquestionably antediluvian.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the cultural standard of
the Manchus is much below the average Chinese
level. The people look more barbarous to begin
with, their occupations are all of a rough nature,
and the old Confucian doctrines have never
penetrated to them. They have always led a
merely animal rather than an intellectual life,
an existence of strife rather than of thought,
and to this day the Imperial army consists
almost exclusively of Manchu soldiers.</p>

<p>Our progress was very slow. For many days
we travelled on leisurely, with occasional stoppages
long enough to enable me to make excursions
into the interior. I tried every means
of conveyance&mdash;bullock-carts, Mongol ponies,
Cossack horses. It was tiring work, but gave
me extraordinary opportunities of making myself
familiar with the country and its inhabitants.
At last I reached Kharbin, a famous town, being
the junction where the three railways of Manchuria
meet, viz. the Vladivostok, the Port
Arthur, and the Siberian lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_70.jpg" alt="Kharbin" />
<p class="caption">KHARBIN<br />"Of all the places I have visited during this long journey, Kharbin seems to me the dreariest"<br />
[To face page 70]</p></div>

<p>Of all the places I have visited during this
long journey, Kharbin seems to me the dreariest,
the most desolate. A dull, cold autumn afternoon
greeted me on my arrival. The rain fell<span class="pagenum">[71]</span><a name="index71"></a>
in torrents; not only did the water pour down
from the skies, but it oozed up from the ground
as well. The river had overflowed, and all the
land was inundated. Half the place stood
under water. The railway station looked like
a little island in the midst of a marsh. Together
with the few passengers for Vladivostok I was
carried on men's shoulders into the waiting-room,
a mere barn, where we found a mixed
crowd of mujiks and Cossacks with their
luggage, which consisted of bedding, cooking
utensils, packages and bundles of all sorts and
sizes, tied together, piled around them.</p>

<p>The same place also served as refreshment
room, and at one end of it about a dozen officers
were dining at a big table. A pretentious gilded
chandelier&mdash;ironically reminding one of Western
luxury&mdash;formed the centre-piece. But I had no
time to admire its beauty or even to sit down
to my meal, although I was nearly famished.
The station-master came bustling up to me with
a very disconsolate countenance and informed
me that he had received a telegram intimating
that a bridge near Liaoyang had been carried
away by the floods, and that in consequence of
the defective state of the roads it was impossible
to say when the next train would start.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe my consternation
on hearing this depressing announcement,
for I fully realized the awfulness of my position<span class="pagenum">[72]</span><a name="index72"></a>
should I be compelled to make a prolonged stay
in this place. The roads were so bad that excursions
would be out of the question, and I
should have to remain a prisoner in my carriage
until the road was open again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I gladly accepted the offer of a
seat in a <i>tarantass</i> to drive round the town.
Kharbin is of interest from a modern point of
view because it is one of the headquarters of the
Russians in Manchuria.</p>

<p>The town has sprung up within recent years,
about the time of the Chino-Japanese war. It
consists of barracks and military quarters,
ammunition stores, railroad factories, and a few
private houses for the families of officers, railway
officials, and employés. It has no pretence
to beauty, and in the flooded condition in which
I saw it, its gloomy buildings, streaming with
rain, looked deplorable. We came past some
shops where tinned meats, vegetables, and other
provisions are sold. There is also a hotel, which
I prefer not to describe. I was told that the
place even boasts a café and music-hall, the only
place of poor amusement for the officers and
their wives in garrison there. Kharbin is supposed
to have about fifteen thousand inhabitants,
but where were they? Were they dead, asleep,
or hiding? I could not see a single living being.
Could this be altogether accounted for by the
weather, even allowing that the water in the<span class="pagenum">[73]</span><a name="index73"></a>
streets rose to the knees of the horses, and that
the wheels of our vehicle were submerged to the
axle?</p>

<p>As we drove along my amiable guide explained
to me that Kharbin is a military place,
destined to see much active service in the event
of a war, because, being situated on the junction
of three great railway lines, it would be the centre
for the mobilization and concentration of the
troops. It would probably become the headquarters
of the intendant and of the ammunition
service. Hospitals, too, would be erected and
the Red Cross would have a large staff there.
I listened with interest to all these conjectures
and plans for the future.</p>

<p>It was night when we returned to the station,
where an agreeable surprise awaited me. I was
told that a goods train with a convoy of coolies
and troops to repair the line which had been
destroyed, would be ready to start a little after
midnight. Could my carriage be attached to
it? I inquired. At first it seemed doubtful.
No one appeared to know how far we could get,
and there was even some question as to whether
the road would bear the weight of the train.
However, anything, no matter what, would be
better than Kharbin, I thought; even the uncertainty
of the future was preferable to the
certainty of the present.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning, after an<span class="pagenum">[74]</span><a name="index74"></a>
interminable night of bustling, coming and
going of troops, rushing about of coolies, shunting
and whistling of engines, we at last began
to move. The train presented a curious appearance.
It consisted chiefly of open trucks and
a few wagons in which the soldiers lay huddled
together, with their winter coats tucked under
their heads for pillows, while hundreds of coolies
were packed like cattle in the open carriages.</p>

<p>At first we passed slowly through a vast,
partially submerged plain. Often the road was
entirely under water, and in various places so
badly damaged that we had to proceed with the
greatest possible caution. More than once the
coolies had to turn out with pickaxe, shovel,
and building material to repair the line, under
the strict supervision of the officers of the railway
service. I availed myself of the frequent
stoppages and our altogether casual progress to
study the country.</p>

<p>When at last we reached the large province of
Central Manchuria there was a notable change
in the geographical aspect. The ground became
hilly and wooded. We followed several winding
valleys, irrigated by tortuous watercourses, and
surrounded by mountain ridges. In some parts
it was decidedly pretty. The soil is fertile, and
nature has endowed it with many precious gifts.
The mountain slopes are rich in minerals and
the woods abound with game. The mineral<span class="pagenum">[75]</span><a name="index75"></a>
wealth of Manchuria is as yet unexplored, and
there are comparatively few gold, silver, and
copper mines in process of exploitation. Some
foreign syndicates have been formed, more
especially in the south, and these have proved
successful, but since the Russian occupation of
the railway district they have been hampered
by all sorts of difficulties, and except in the free
port of Niu-chwang, the introduction of foreign
capital has been stopped.</p>

<p>In actual size Central Manchuria is considerably
smaller than the northern district of Tsi-tsi-kar&mdash;also
known as Halung-kiang&mdash;but the
population of the north is only about one million,
while Central Manchuria contains twice as many
inhabitants. The seat of government for this
latter district is at Kirin, a very ancient town
with quaint houses built in the old Chinese
style, yamens with shining roofs, temples and
pagodas, all very picturesque.</p>

<p>Kirin itself is famous for the battlemented
wall which, with its heavy ramparts and pagoda-like
towers, is very imposing. But the chief
attraction of this provincial capital is the surrounding
scenery. Valleys and mountains, dark
forests and distant blue mountain peaks, form
a most charming picture. It is indeed a glorious
region, and a joy both to the sportsman and to
the artist. The fishing in the mountain streams
is excellent, and there are still numbers of<span class="pagenum">[76]</span><a name="index76"></a>
leopards, bears, wolves, a certain kind of deer,
foxes, and hares in the forests. For the artist
the opportunities here are not less ample; pretty
woodland scenery, attractive bits of street
corners, and town scenery, and above all the
historical monuments, the celebrated royal
tombs, and the commemorative tablets on the
river banks, or hidden in the sacred groves;
all these are excellent subjects for sketches.</p>

<p>The great difficulty at the present moment is
how to reach these beautiful regions. There
are, so far, only a very few stations in process
of building on this route, and it must be remembered
that even these, though called by the
names of the various places, are often twenty or
thirty miles distant from the towns they represent,
and that there are scarcely any means of
conveyance, and that in many cases there is not
even a road!</p>

<p>It would seem as if the Eastern Chinese Railway
scrupulously avoided all inhabited regions,
and certainly in its present condition, and as
long as there are no branch lines, it is useless
for all purposes of ordinary traffic or commercial
enterprise. The Russian officers who have
projected it appear to have had only one object
in view, to connect in the most direct manner
Vladivostok and Port Arthur with the Siberian
line, for the sole purpose of transporting
troops in case of need with the least possible
delay.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_76.jpg" alt="A street in Kharbin" />
<p class="caption">A STREET IN KHARBIN<br />"The water in the streets rose to the knees of the horses"<br />
[To face page 76]</p></div>

<p>All this great work has been done quietly,<span class="pagenum">[77]</span><a name="index77"></a>
unostentatiously, and without arousing any ill-feeling
among the natives. At the present
moment one may travel for a whole day without
catching sight of anything more conspicuous
than railway buildings, barracks, and encampments
with Russian soldiers lining the entire
length of the route.</p>

<p>After several days' travelling we emerged into
cultivated plains, rich pasture land intersected
by patches of Indian corn, beans, etc. Crops
of all kinds presented themselves before our
eyes. The country no longer showed the barren
desolation of the Gobi desert, nor the romantic
wildness of Central Manchuria. It was peopled!
There were men working in the fields, and I
could see houses and little farms, poor and
miserable enough it is true, but at least indicative
of human life.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p class="center">FROM MUKDEN STATION TO MUKDEN TOWN</p>

<p>It was dawn when I looked out of my carriage
window&mdash;a dull grey dawn. The sky was
covered with leaden clouds and the rain came
down in torrents. The river banks were entirely
submerged, and the train stood still in a sea of
mud. The scene of general deluge vividly recalled<span class="pagenum">[78]</span><a name="index78"></a>
my ideas of the Flood, and it was like
stepping out of the ark when I alighted from
my carriage. Close by I saw a modest structure,
one storey high, more like a peasant's hut
than anything else, and I could scarcely believe
that this was the station intended for Mukden,
the capital of Manchuria. To my consternation
I learnt that the train would go no farther that
day. It might go on to-morrow or perhaps in
a week's time.</p>

<p>There was plenty of time therefore to explore
Mukden, although the town was over twenty
miles away. But how was I to get there?
There was no road to be seen and no vehicle
anywhere about. I made inquiries from the
station-master, a Russian officer, with a long
beard and resplendent with gold lace. He advised
me to send my interpreter to one of the
neighbouring farms, where I might possibly
obtain a Chinese cart, a driver, and a couple of
mules, to convey me to Mukden in as short a
time as the state of the roads would permit.
I followed this advice. The courier wasted the
greater part of the day in arguing with the
farmers, while I was left in my carriage at the
mercy of the hurricane, and occupied the time
in writing down my unpleasant impressions,
wind and rain supplying the accompaniment of
music.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the afternoon my faithful<span class="pagenum">[79]</span><a name="index79"></a>
Sancho returned, and pointed to a kind of
cabriolet on two wheels with three mules harnessed
in tandem fashion, and driven by a
crooked little Chinaman. I cannot deny that
the effect was extremely picturesque. The car
was lacquered yellow, the hood covered with
blue; the mules were grey, and the little driver
was sheltered by a huge umbrella of gold-coloured
oil-cloth. But although picturesque, it was far
from comfortable. The vehicle had no springs
and no seat; in fact, it consisted simply of a
wooden board about two and a half feet square,
on which one had to sit cross-legged like a Turk
or a tailor. If the occupant happens to be
neither the one nor the other, he suffers agonies
before five minutes have passed. The only
attempt at comfort was a small calico rug at the
bottom of the cart, but this was a poor protection
against the extremely hard wood of Manchuria.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment before venturing to
enter this uncomfortable conveyance, and pictured
vividly to myself the horrors of a night's
journey in it. But I had promised to visit,
if possible, the site of our Mission station, which
had been pillaged and burned in the last Boxer
insurrection, and which had been the scene of
so much noble martyrdom. So after all I made
up my mind to go.</p>

<p>Little Li-Hu cracked his long whip, which, by<span class="pagenum">[80]</span><a name="index80"></a>
the by, looked more like a fishing rod than a
whip. And indeed, I might have amused myself
with some angling on the way, for the mules
were up to their fetlocks in chocolate-coloured
liquid mud.</p>

<p>The first sight which attracted my attention
on the road was a one-storeyed building, used
as barracks and occupied by Cossacks. I learnt
that it served as an encampment for the protection
of the railway station.</p>

<p>Then followed a long stretch of road without
anything remarkable to be seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_80.jpg" alt="From Mukden flats on to the town" />
<p class="caption">FROM MUKDEN FLATS ON TO THE TOWN<br />After a Water-colour Drawing by the Author<br />
"Then followed a long stretch of road without anything<br />remarkable to be seen"<br />
[To face page 80]</p></div>

<p>There were fields on both sides of the way,
but they could not be seen because all the land
was entirely submerged as in Egypt at the rising
of the Nile. I presumed that we were on a road,
for we advanced between two rows of irregularly
planted trees; I also concluded that at
one time this road had been paved, perhaps
centuries ago, but it was decidedly bumpy now.</p>

<p>These speculations were presently confirmed
when we arrived at a bridge delicately arching
a creek. It was a very fine structure, carved
in Chinese fashion, and of great architectural
beauty. I left my carriage to examine it more
closely, and when I had scraped off some of the
mud with which it was encrusted, I found that
it was entirely built of white marble.</p>

<p>After crossing the river the road became still
worse. I was jolted up and down, thrown from<span class="pagenum">[81]</span><a name="index81"></a>
side to side, my head was knocked against the
wooden frame of the hood, and after a mile or
so of this torture I could bear it no longer and
decided to try the back of one of the mules.</p>

<p>Riding without a saddle on the back of a thin
Manchu mule cannot be said to be a comfortable
mode of travelling, and my agonies are
better imagined than described.</p>

<p>Here was I, in an unknown country, surrounded
by a desert which seemed more desolate
than ever in its flooded condition, the rain coming
down as if all the sluices of heaven had been
opened, while the tiny driver at whose mercy I
was, might, for all I knew, be a cut-throat.</p>

<p>My vocabulary was as yet limited to two words,
<i>how-di</i> and <i>poo-how</i>. Perhaps they are written
quite differently, but this is how they sound.
The former stands for everything that is good,
pretty, pleasant (I have never had occasion to
use it); the other expresses the reverse, and I
was quite tired of saying it, because it never
proved to be of the slightest effect.</p>

<p>We encountered no one on the road, but passed
one little vehicle like mine, in which I counted
at least ten visible occupants. Four were
seated on the shafts, some on the mules, and
the others outside on the hood. I could not
see how many there were inside. All the outside
passengers had large umbrellas of oil-cloth,
the same as my driver, and they looked like big<span class="pagenum">[82]</span><a name="index82"></a>
sunflowers. It was quite cheering to see those
people so perfectly happy, laughing and joking
under such wretched conditions.</p>

<p>Their stoicism gave me relief, and I shook the
water from my dripping clothes and felt a little
better too. But as night approached and the
desolation became more oppressive, my self-confidence
fell from hour to hour. Darkness
magnified all the surroundings, and gave them
a fantastic aspect. The lights in the distant
farm-houses looked like will-o'-the-wisps; the
trees became phantoms, and the barking of the
dogs sounded like the roar of the dragons, which,
as every one knows, are natives of the Yellow
Empire. All the fairy stories of my childhood
came back to my memory, and assumed a shape
in the reality of my surroundings.</p>

<p>I must add, too, that what I had read lately
about Manchuria was not encouraging. The
country, I knew, was still in a state of agitation
and suppressed revolt. Gangs of bandits traversed
the country in all directions, burning
farmsteads, pillaging villages, murdering travellers.
Skirmishes often took place between them
and the Cossacks, and more than once during
my journey I heard the firing of shots. The
most dreaded of all these ruffians are the Chunchuses;
they are formed into more or less
organized bodies, like the bandits of ancient
Italy, and they possess as much influence as the<span class="pagenum">[83]</span><a name="index83"></a>
Mafia of Sicily.</p>

<p>It was getting late and we had travelled for
many hours without seeing any trace of houses.
I could ask no questions, because I could only
say those two words, <i>poo-how</i> and <i>how-di</i>.
Even if Li-Hu had been of a communicative turn
of mind I should not have understood his explanations,
so we continued our lugubrious ride
in perfect silence, I perched on the back of a
mule, with the shafts of the cart for stirrups,
while Li-Hu had the carriage all to himself.
He wriggled about like a serpent and finally
sought consolation for the bitter reality of the
present in the happy dreams of the past.</p>

<p>At last the will-o'-the-wisps drew nearer, the
phantoms took the form of ordinary trees, and
the roars of the dragons resolved themselves
into the barking of dogs.</p>

<p>I scarcely dared to believe that I had reached
my destination, lest I should be disappointed.
Li-Hu was sound asleep, but the mules made
straight for a dismal-looking building, and
stopped as by instinct in front of a conspicuous
signboard. By the same instinct, I suppose,
Li-Hu awoke and I asked eagerly, "Mukden?
Mukden?" But evidently I was wrong, for
he emphatically shook his head.</p>

<p>After a while the innkeeper appeared on the
threshold and looked even more forbidding than
the house itself, through the open doors of which<span class="pagenum">[84]</span><a name="index84"></a>
escaped thick clouds of opium-smoke. I should
have preferred to remain on the back of my
mule, as there was no possibility of stretching
my legs because of the mud, but they were
already unharnessing my beast, so I had no
choice, and was obliged to enter the house.</p>

<p>The place was lugubrious in the extreme. It
looked like a witch's cave, and all things combined
to complete this impression. There was
the cauldron hanging on a chain over the fire,
while enormous logs of wood diffused a sulphurous
flame in the light of which the inmates of
the place looked truly terrible. At least a dozen
men were crouching on the floor, and several
others lay asleep on the kang or heated earthen
bench which ran all along the dwelling. They
were smoking opium in small bronze pipes.</p>

<p>At my entrance most of them roused themselves
from their stupor, and their small eyes
expressed astonishment, united with curiosity,
mistrust, and hatred. I could detect all the
hostility of the East against the West in that
look. The ill-will of the yellow race towards
"the white devils" manifested itself in all its
bitterness and force. I must confess that I did
not feel quite at my ease in this uncanny company,
and it was only the deep interest which
I felt in these people, in the den and its surroundings,
the novelty of the situation and my
passionate interest in human nature, which<span class="pagenum">[85]</span><a name="index85"></a>
helped me through the ordeal.</p>

<p>What was going to happen? Would they
remain passive, or were they going to attack
me? They were interrogating Li-Hu. It was
like a play to watch the proceedings. Without
understanding the language, it was easy enough
to follow the drift of the argument. "Who is
it? Where is he going? What has he got?"</p>

<p>From the expression of Li-Hu's face and his
hesitation in answering, I gathered that the
information he had to give concerning his charge
was not satisfactory, but I also noted with
interest how cleverly he concocted a story to his
own advantage. Evidently the shrewd Chinaman
had in his mind two strong points in my
favour. In the first place I had not yet paid
him, and in the second place I had been entrusted
to his care by the station-master, by whom he
was known. I also detected that he did not
want to rouse the animosity of the other men,
consequently he never mentioned my private
car, probably also by the advice of the station-master,
and from the expression of his face and
the manner in which he turned out his pockets,
he was clearly representing me as a poor missionary
who was going to Mukden to fetch his pay
at the bank, and whom it would not be worth
while to kidnap on his way there.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged on like so many hours;
the night seemed endless. Finally, to pass the<span class="pagenum">[86]</span><a name="index86"></a>
time, I began to draw with some coloured chalks.
Would that interest them? I wondered. I
could not be sure at first, but the ruffians slowly
gathered round me and I never had more complacent
spectators. Those men who, a few
minutes ago, would have taken my life, or at
least my purse, suddenly became quite friendly.
Like the lyre of Orpheus, my pictures did wonders,
soothing the savage instincts and softening
the passions of these brigands. It was the
greatest triumph my modest crayons ever won
for me.</p>

<p>At last there was a general stir. Li-Hu prepared
his cart, and we started once more.
It was still dark, but the rain had ceased and
the cold rays of the moon from time to time
broke through the parting clouds. By means
of these occasional flashes of light I discerned
in the distance, silhouetted against the horizon,
the dark outlines of a pagoda. Surely that was
the point we were making for. We had long
since left the so-called main road, and were jolting
and jerking along by fields of turnips and
Indian corn. The shocks were perhaps not
quite so rough as before, on the half-paved highroad,
but their violence was yet amazing.</p>

<p>It was daybreak when we arrived before the
principal gate of Mukden, and after the night
of darkness and peril the glories of the city
seemed enhanced. The sky was cloudless and<span class="pagenum">[87]</span><a name="index87"></a>
intensely blue, as if enamelled in cobalt on a
golden ground. The richly sculptured fronts of
the houses shone with truly Oriental splendour.
It was the early hour of the morn. People
poured out of the city gates to start their daily
tasks in the fields and farms. Every one wore
bright-coloured garments, and looked happy
and cheerful. Everything breathed contentment:
the effect was charming. It was the
victory of light over darkness.</p>

<p>The sun, like a great magician, had waved his
wand, touched and dispersed clouds and gloom,
and thrown, so it would seem, a veil of oblivion
over the sadness and misery of the past night,
to give courage and hope to begin another day.</p>

<p class="center "><b>THE CAPITAL OF MANCHURIA</b><span class="pagenum">[88]</span><a name="index88"></a></p>


<p>My surprise on first beholding the famous
city of Mukden was as complete as it was
agreeable. The scene before me was simply
delightful. At first I could not distinguish
anything clearly, neither lines nor forms. I
was dazzled by the intensity of colour and light.</p>

<p>The façade of every house was ornamented
with strange carvings and mouldings; never
before had I seen such fantastic prodigality of
human imagination. All the lines curve upward,
and every house resembles a pagoda on
a small scale. So many motives, so many
different colours; red, yellow, green, blue, in
endless profusion, the effect being increased by
rich gilding.</p>

<p>In front of the houses are shops or booths,
where are exposed&mdash;generally in the open&mdash;goods
and merchandise of all kinds, arranged
in fanciful pyramids in accordance with Oriental
caprice. Embroideries, rich silks, artificial
flowers, fans, and umbrellas, anything, in fact,
to tempt the local taste or satisfy the daily
demands. The displays of porcelain are particularly
attractive, also the shows of silver and
brass ware. Most fascinating are the stalls of<span class="pagenum">[89]</span><a name="index89"></a>
the bric-à-brac dealers with their fine lacquer-work,
fluted vases of priceless value, old porcelains,
cloisonné boxes, and artistically designed
snuff-bottles[2].</p>

<p class="footnote">[2] The Chinese do not use boxes,
but snuff-bottles of great value.</p>

<p>Before every booth a tall mast or pole is
dressed, from which floats a flag as signboard,
and both are elaborately inscribed with advertisements
of wares sold inside the shop. The bootmakers'
insignia are particularly artistic and
only surpassed in splendour by the rich festoons
of gold which mark the pawnbrokers' shops.
The main thoroughfare, with its endless variety
of cabalistic design and rich colouring, is like
an Oriental bazaar or the gorgeous scenery of
a theatre. But what struck me most was the
enormous vitality and activity of this marvellous
city.</p>

<p>It was like watching an ants' nest to see this
surging tide of human beings incessantly flooding
the squares and streets. Men and women,
young and old, of all ranks and all nationalities,
push and press past one another. Some are
carried in beautiful chairs, others content themselves
with a modest kind of wheelbarrow, in
which six or seven persons can be accommodated
on a narrow board, and which is
pushed along by a famished-looking coolie.
These wheelbarrows answer the purpose of
omnibuses in the Manchu capital, and they take<span class="pagenum">[90]</span><a name="index90"></a>
a person from one end of the city to the other
for about a quarter of a halfpenny. "Rickshaws"
have recently come into fashion; they
are a great improvement on the old means of
conveyance, for instead of being pushed they
are pulled along. All true Manchus, however,
prefer riding on horseback to any other mode of
locomotion.</p>

<p>Whatever room is left in the street is taken
up by pedestrians, labourers carrying enormous
loads, and coolies going about their daily
business. It is an impressive sight, and once
more I came to the conclusion that the intrinsic
character of a place is not expressed in the
arrangement of its streets, or in the height and
style of its buildings, but in the general manifestation
of its activity.</p>

<p>While the eye takes in all these various
details, the ear need not be idle. The air is
full of sound. Strains of music proceeding from
the tea-houses, costermongers' cries, shrieks of
quarrelsome children, and high-pitched voices
in admonition; shouting and noise of all sorts
and in endless variety are heard.</p>

<p>At every step there is a fresh surprise. Fortunately,
so far, no guide-books have been written
to describe the attractions of the Manchu
capital, and no cumbersome descriptions spoil
the effect of its genuine charms</p>

<p>To form an idea of the plan of the city,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span><a name="index91"></a>
imagine an oblong chess-board. Like all Chinese
towns, it is regular in the principal lines. There
are two main streets in the form of a cross,
intersected by innumerable narrow lanes, and
in the middle of the town, where the two chief
thoroughfares cross, stands a high tower from
the top of which a drum and a gong announce
the beginning and the close of the day. Also
from this high vantage ground the alarm is
given in case of danger, and a detachment of
soldiers, stationed in a sort of pigeon-holes, spend
the hours of their watch in peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to enumerate all the
places of interest which Mukden contains, for
everything is interesting to the Western mind,
even to the smallest cottage with its curiously
shaped roof and quaint style. And the interest
lies not only in their material conception or in
their exterior, but also in their inner qualities,
and especially in the fact that they give expression
to the mental and artistic ideas of the
nation. As has already been said, it is at first
the general effect, the picturesqueness, and the
novelty, which strike one as so charming.
Some of the houses are very dilapidated, the
walls lean over, and the roofs are covered with
a tangled growth of moss and grass. But all
this makes them the more attractive from an
artistic point of view.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting public edifices<span class="pagenum">[92]</span><a name="index92"></a>
are the yamens belonging to the Government,
and occupied by the Governor and some others
of the mandarins of high degree; one or two
Lama monasteries; the large buildings where
the Russian Consul and the Commander-in-Chief
reside; and last, but not least, the building
occupied by the famous Russo-Chinese Bank
and its agents.</p>

<p>Naturally the Imperial Palace is a place of
great interest. With its enclosure of walls it
forms a city within the city. It is divided into
various courts, and consists of a great many
separate structures, detached houses, halls, and
pavilions. Taken separately these are not of
great importance, but the whole effect is very
striking. The colonnades, beams, and brackets
are of carved wood, richly painted and gilded.
All the woodwork is painted dark purple, and
the roofs, like those of all edifices connected
with the Imperial Family, or dedicated to Confucius,
are covered with yellow tiles. The
greater part of the palace is now occupied by
Russian troops.</p>

<p>Near the palace gate is a low building in which
a whole detachment of soldiers is quartered,
and the open court is lined with cannon. It
was only on my showing them a special permission
from the commander that the sentries
allowed me to pass.</p>

<p>The interior of the palace is in a sad state of<span class="pagenum">[93]</span><a name="index93"></a>
ruin. Since the Imperial Family departed for
Pekin, it has never been inhabited, and the few
art treasures still remaining are carelessly
scattered about the place. There are some
valuable panels, some precious jades, and
exquisite porcelains, but the greater portion of
them disappeared after the last war. Some
say that these treasures have been stolen by the
Boxers, but according to another version the
thieves must be looked for elsewhere. I was
told that the very rare collection of old manuscripts
and official documents is now quietly
reposing among the archives at St. Petersburg
to be protected from destruction.</p>

<p>My eyes wandered from the reception-halls to
the vestibules, from the terraces to the gardens.
It was all so original, so quaint. But the thing
which specially strikes the visitor is the incongruity
of transforming this sacred cradle of the
master minds of the Celestial Empire into a
Cossack encampment. As I passed out through
the principal entrance, a Muscovite warrior
stood on guard by the Dragon's door, and his
white blouse contrasted strangely with the
heavy bulk of the palace.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, the crowds in the city
increased. Russian soldiers paraded the streets
and patrolled the ramparts in small detachments.
I saw officers on frisky ponies and ladies with
their families going about in the national<span class="pagenum">[94]</span><a name="index94"></a>
<i>troïkas</i>.</p>

<p>It is especially noteworthy that these Russian
people not only feel perfectly at home among
the Manchus, but that the conquered people
associate on the most friendly terms with their
conquerors in the taverns and inns. They
sit amicably side by side and appear to be the
best of friends. It is true that many of the
enemies were born on the same soil; they are
practically semi-Asiatics themselves; often have
a common origin, and belong to the same race;
above all, live the same primitive and uncultivated
life.</p>

<p>The great difference which separates the
European, whether of the Anglo-Saxon or the
Latin race, from the Mongol and the Tartar,
does not exist here. As soon as a fight is concluded,
they settle down to their ordinary life;
the greatest cruelties committed on either side
are soon forgotten. Hatred may lurk in their
innermost minds, but outwardly they live in
peace together.</p>

<p>They have the same tastes, the same amusements,
and agree particularly on the question of
frugality. Contempt of comfort, indifference
to refinement, and a very rudimentary degree
of culture, are common to both of them. One
thing which even more prevents any feeling of
coldness arising between them is that, far from
trying to transform and educate the conquered<span class="pagenum">[95]</span><a name="index95"></a>
nation, the conquerors often stoop to the low
level of the subjugated people.</p>

<p>With the exception of the railway I am not
aware that any attempts have been made to
civilize the Manchus. Commerce is not encouraged
and international traffic does not
exist, because all the towns have thus far been
closed to foreigners. The Russian Government
is even taking steps to get into its own hands
the English and American mining operations
which are being financed by some new loans.
In spiritual matters the same restrictions
prevail, and the difficulties which are put in
the way of the missionary work increase from
day to day.</p>

<p>In local government a semblance of the old
forms is preserved. Manchuria is divided into
three administrations, Tsi-tsi-kar, Kirin, and
Mukden. Each province has a governor, and
all three are under the authority of a viceroy or
mandarin of the highest rank, who resides at
Mukden.</p>

<p>The official yamen, and the staff of dignitaries
of various degrees, are here exactly what they
are everywhere else. They all appear extremely
busy, writing extraordinary cabalistic signs on
sheets of rice-paper. The small details of local
affairs keep them occupied all day; probably
they know nothing of matters of serious importance,
but they seem admirably suited to<span class="pagenum">[96]</span><a name="index96"></a>
fill a post which involves a minimum of responsibility
and brings with it a good substantial
salary. There appears to be a perfect <i>entente
cordiale</i> between the Manchu mandarins and
the Russian generals, and if perchance a difference
of opinion should occur, the difficulty is
generally smoothed over by the irresistible influence
and the mysterious power of the
Russo-Chinese Bank.</p>

<p>The important event of my first day was the
official reception given by the Governor. I
was carried to the palace in a chair, followed by
an interpreter and my little major-domo. The
canopy of the chair was covered with green silk,
and four stalwart fellows carried me through the
narrow, tortuous streets. The shaking was
terrible, for where the pavement should have
been there were big holes filled with liquid mud.
I could forgive my bearers for their rough handling
of my chair, but it was difficult not to resent
being bumped on to the ground every time they
changed shoulders, which they did without
slackening their pace. It was not a great
height to fall from, but the sensation was
decidedly unpleasant. It was like a nightmare;
the time occupied by the fall seemed interminable,
and on reaching the ground I felt like being
hurled to the bottom of a precipice.</p>

<p>At last we came to the principal entrance of
the palace, at least what I supposed to be the<span class="pagenum">[97]</span><a name="index97"></a>
principal entrance, judging from a group of
queerly attired creatures, who presented arms&mdash;and
such arms! It was an extraordinary
collection, reminding me of the get-up of some
old Chinese play. They were fierce-looking
warriors, carrying halberds, javelins, and sickles
on long poles, glittering and sparkling in the
midday sun.</p>

<p>As seen from the outside, the palace is a
poor structure. The massive wall which flanks
the front gate is decorated with pictures
of dragons to scare away, as I was told, evil
spirits and "the white devils." The first
court I came to was not much more attractive.
It seemed, in fact, no better than a stable yard.
There were a few horses tied to their stalls
and some shelters for the soldiers and servants.
I had to cross several courts before I arrived at
the court of honour, which was square like the
others, and had halls on each side. It was
beautifully decorated with flowers and shrubs.
There were chrysanthemums, and dwarf orange,
peach, and pear trees, especially cultivated for
the purpose of ornamentation. The effect produced
was exquisite, and though the surroundings
are all more or less in a state of decadence,
that inner court is a picturesque specimen of
Chinese domestic architecture.</p>

<p>But I had no time to study it in detail, for
the Mandarin stood there in the centre, surrounded<span class="pagenum">[98]</span><a name="index98"></a>
by his court. He was in a robe of dark
blue silk, magnificently embroidered, and his
suite was no less gorgeously attired. When
I appeared upon the threshold of the vestibule
we exchanged profound bows, and repeated this
salutation until we met half way. Then we
shook hands in Western fashion, no easy task,
considering that my host's finger-nails were at
least two inches long. The customary introductions
over, he led the way to his private
apartments.</p>

<p>The first room was entirely Chinese, and contained
some exquisitely carved armchairs. The
effect of the second room was spoiled by two
easy chairs of Vienna manufacture, a hideous
French clock, and a tablecloth, probably of
Manchester make.</p>

<p>The preliminary compliments once exchanged&mdash;a
formidable business here&mdash;His Excellency
asked me some dozen questions which in the
West would be considered most indiscreet, but
are obligatory in the East. Then he conducted
me to the dining-hall, where luncheon was
set on a round table profusely decorated with
flowers and sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Innumerable little dishes were scattered over
the silk tablecloth, and saucers filled with raisins,
grapes, almonds, olives, and a variety of dainties.
Etiquette prescribes that the guest shall be
placed on the left of his host, and that the first<span class="pagenum">[99]</span><a name="index99"></a>
mouthful of food shall be put on to his plate
by the host himself. After that the servants
bring in dishes containing the most delicate
productions of the Chinese culinary art. Fish
soup and snail soup, sharks' fins in unpalatable
jellies, all kinds of minces and hashes, and
patties with sauces most unpleasant to Western
taste, composed the menu.</p>

<p>Custom, which regulates all public and social
functions in this country, demands that no less
than fifty different dishes be presented to a
guest of distinction. All these concoctions are
handed round on large trays, in series of eight
at a time. They look different, but all taste
alike, at least so it seemed to me. They are
both sweet and sour, and whether they go by
the name of minced birds'-nests, or croquettes
of dog-flesh, I could detect no difference in
taste. The other guests, however, fully made
up for my want of appreciation.</p>

<p>As the meal proceeded, the conversation became
more animated. When the subjects dictated
by ceremony had been disposed of, the
company expressed much interest in my researches
and studies. My host questioned me
on many points. He was decidedly clever,
and although one was apt to forget the solemnity
of the occasion on looking at his somewhat
ridiculous costume and hat, formed in the shape
of a pagoda surmounted by a precious stone<span class="pagenum">[100]</span><a name="index100"></a>
the size of a potato, and adorned with waving
peacock's feathers&mdash;in which attire even the
wisest man would look a fool&mdash;I could not help
being impressed by his sagacity.</p>

<p>He was somewhat reserved, but seemed
pleased to talk about his country, and gave me
some valuable information when he saw how
much interested I was in the ancient history
of the land, and the origin of its inhabitants.
For they, thousands of years ago, had proceeded
from the same stock as the people of my own
race, who had founded the kingdom in Pannonia.
The foundation of the Manchu empire
is connected even more closely than I thought
with the migration of the Huns. It would,
indeed, open a vast field of study for the historian
to seek the connecting link and the
affinity existing between the first Magyars and
Manchus.</p>

<p>The repast over, the Governor proposed a
visit to the imperial tombs, the chief sight of
the country. Indeed, there is nothing the
people venerate more deeply than those monuments
of the defunct members of their dynasty;
they are the pride of the nation.</p>

<p>We started without much delay. It was a
glorious afternoon, and in the brightness of the
autumn sun the country looked its best. Our
cavalcade galloped across pasture land, where
horses and cattle peaceably grazed together.<span class="pagenum">[101]</span><a name="index101"></a>
Here and there a shepherd sought diversion in
the consoling melody of some old song, like
all human beings whose lives are spent in solitude,
and in the contemplation of the immensity
of nature. The music was simple and the instrument
simpler still, an archaic flute cut out
of a reed.</p>

<p>Skirting the far end of the pasture was a dark
brushwood; my companions told me that this
was the sacred grove containing the imperial
tombs. The distance to the town might be about
six or seven miles, but our little horses carried us
quickly over the ground. The Manchu dignitaries,
in their flowing silken robes, their pagoda-like
hats, their embroideries and long pigtails,
looked unquestionably most picturesque. My
mount and my saddle were similar to theirs,
pretty, but at the same time I must say that I
never rode on anything more uncomfortable
than a Chinese saddle of embossed wood, with
stirrups in the shape of slippers, and fixed so
high that knees and chin nearly meet.</p>

<p>Two large stone monuments flank the path
which leads to the sacred grove. Forbidding-looking
dragons guard the entrance. A deep
cutting gives access to the place of interment,
and this long alley is guarded on both sides by
monsters of various descriptions. Elephants,
camels, gigantic human figures, are placed at
intervals facing each other, all cut in stone, and<span class="pagenum">[102]</span><a name="index102"></a>
intended to ward off the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The beauty of the place is indescribable.
The darkness of the foliage, the white stone
statues, and the paved pathway winding through
the woods, all help to give it the character of
an enchanted forest, where solitude reigns, and
the air is full of poetry.</p>

<p>Later we crossed some marble bridges of exquisite
workmanship, their curiously sculptured
balustrades softly reflecting themselves
in the blue waters of the little streams flowing
lazily between the flowering banks. I was told
that the statues, the streams, and the bridges,
have all of them some allegorical meaning in
connexion with the spirits of the departed.</p>

<p>At length, passing through a porch, we stood
face to face with an arch of such surpassing
beauty, that for a moment I was dazed and lost
in speechless admiration. Surely this must be
one of the greatest, one of the most wonderful
architectural creations of the Yellow Empire.
Material, design, proportions, all the details,
are so supremely beautiful. It is of marble,
the arch resting on two huge blocks with cross-bars
and buttresses supported by imperial
dragons. The decorations are exquisite, and
the carving of the friezes unique of its kind.
Not even among all the marvellous monuments
of Pekin, Nankin, or Hankow, did I find anything
to rival it. The beauty of the conception,<span class="pagenum">[103]</span><a name="index103"></a>
as well as the finished workmanship, impress
one most forcibly, because of its being so perfectly
in keeping with the signification of the
whole triumphal arch, which symbolizes the
passage of the spirit, after a life of strife and
victory, to the abodes of their ancestors and
everlasting peace. In this respect I know of
nothing to compare with it, unless it be that
pearl of Asiatic architecture, the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>The tomb itself is enclosed by courts, halls,
sacrificial temples, guard-houses, and sentry-sheds.
We left our horses at the inner entrance,
and the massive doors of red lacquer-work
groaned on their hinges as they were slowly
pushed open by half a dozen soldiers. We
found ourselves in a square yard, a kind of
court of honour, with avenues of trees many
centuries old, giants and monsters in stone,
and canals fenced in with marble balustrades
and arched by bridges. These courts are
divided by open galleries which lead to the
central pagoda. This square building contains
the commemorative tablet, a monument cut
out of a single stone of about thirty feet high.
The whole stands on a colossal tortoise, larger
than two elephants.</p>

<p>Immense cauldrons, big enough to cook a
whole ox at a time, for sacrificial purposes, are
placed at short distances. Once a year a great
ceremony is held in honour of the Great Ancestor.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span><a name="index104"></a>
On this occasion the Emperor should be present
in person, but for many years the imperial court
has been represented by ambassadors; and
considering what a journey from Pekin to
Mukden involves, it is not surprising that the
sovereign is content to be present by proxy.
I was told that the mandarins selected to undertake
this onerous pilgrimage are often persons
whose presence is not desired at Pekin. Their
adventurous journey often occupies many
months, and often there have been cases in
which the envoys never returned at all.</p>

<p>The Great Ancestor was one of the founders
of the Manchu dynasty in China, and his real
tomb is cut out in the heart of the mountain,
but the exact spot is unknown. We spent the
greater part of the afternoon among the tombs,
and I made the best use I could of the permission
to sketch and to take photographs. But the
most perfect apparatus, and the pen of the most
accomplished narrator, are bound to fail to do
justice to the reality. Art and nature are
blended so exquisitely here that it is impossible
to give an adequate idea of the place. However
beautiful the individual monuments may
be&mdash;and they are very beautiful&mdash;the real charm
of the ideal site lies in the perfect harmony of
solitude and peace.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ENTRANCE TO THE IMPERIAL TOMBS<br />"The massive doors of red lacquer-work groaned on their hinges"<br />
[To face page 104]</p></div>

<p>On the return journey we again passed
through the muddy, dreary suburbs. Most of<span class="pagenum">[105]</span><a name="index105"></a>
the houses along the dull, deserted roads, are
built of clay and covered with straw. Rough
planks close the entrance, and from the windows
the rice-paper hangs down in tatters. We met
several funeral processions, the huge black
coffins being carried in front.</p>

<p>I have forgotten to mention that cholera
was raging in the town; hundreds of people
died daily, and the sanitary conditions of the
place were so wretched that nothing could be
done to stop it. Considering the manner in
which the coolies live, it is only surprising that
they do not all succumb. On this account the
authorities at first had been averse to the idea
of my visit to Mukden, but as there was smallpox
in China and typhoid fever in Korea, there
did not seem much to choose between the two;
and, besides, I was firmly convinced that
Providence would let me finish the work I had
undertaken to do.</p>

<p>The epidemic broke out three months ago,
and had claimed many victims among the
Russian troops. The morale of the men was
at a very low ebb in consequence. Upon the
coolies and the Manchus the effect was different.
Their innate fatalism teaches them to look upon
death as a benevolent friend, and as they bear
away the coffins with the remains of their loved
ones, they look as unconcerned as if they were
taking them to a place of joy. All the small<span class="pagenum">[106]</span><a name="index106"></a>
objects cherished by the dead are placed upon
the coffin to be burned at the grave-side, and
when the smoke rises up to heaven, popular
superstition has it that all these objects assume
shape again in a higher sphere, for the gratification
of their former owners. It is only right,
however, to add, that as the heirs are solicitous
to save anything that may be of value, counterfeits
of the real things, in paper or cardboard,
are often substituted, and so the <i>auto-da-fé</i>
takes place only in effigy.</p>

<p>Having been entertained at luncheon by the
Chinese Governor, to make the day complete
I was the guest of the Russian Resident at
dinner. We may criticize the Muscovite system
of government, we may censure the ways and
means employed by the Russian administration,
but there is only one opinion as regards
Russian hospitality. No matter what quarter
of the globe one comes from, whether one be
a political ally or a traditional foe, a Russian
never fails in the duties of hospitality. As long
as the guest is under his roof he is looked upon
as a member of the family. Host and hostess,
in fact all the household, go out of their way to
show kindness to him. And it is all done on
such a lavish scale! His room is overheated,
rugs and furs are wrapped round him whether
he desires them or not, and above all a special
point is made of loading him with food and<span class="pagenum">[107]</span><a name="index107"></a>
drink at all hours of the day and of the night.</p>

<p>The Russian Residence, or Consulate, as it
is still sometimes called before the world, is a
yamen like all other public buildings in China,
only perhaps a little more ruinous than those
I saw in the morning. The interior is greatly
lacking in comfort and luxury. It gives rather
the impression of a camp than of a home; there
is no furniture beyond what is strictly necessary,
and nothing has been done to make it pretty or
attractive. The only redeeming feature is the
table, which appears to be permanently set for
meals. It is covered with quite as many little
dishes as the table of the Mandarin, but instead
of fruit and sweetmeats, they contain hors-d'&oelig;uvres,
such as caviare, herrings, smoked
salmon, cucumber, and all the innumerable
varieties which compose the famous national
<i>Zakouska</i>. There was a perfect array of bottles
on the table; I do not remember ever seeing so
many crowded on to one table. There were
wines from the Crimea, various liqueurs, and
vodka. During dinner the guests smoked perfumed
cigarettes, and talked of their family
affairs and distant homes. It was difficult to
realize that the boundless plains of Siberia separated
us from the banks of the Neva, for the
picture before me was so typically Russian,
in all its variety of shades and colours. I almost
felt as if I were "in company with the gentlemen"<span class="pagenum">[108]</span><a name="index108"></a>
of Tourgueniéff.</p>

<p>My visit to Mukden had certainly been full
of interest. Not only the town itself, its famous
monuments, and its strangely superannuated
people, but the whole situation as it is at present,
offers endless scope for speculation. Chinese
mandarins and Russian generals, Cossacks and
coolies, how oddly they are amalgamated in
incoherent groups! What developments may
not the future have in store? Truly this is
a fascinating problem. Will Manchuria be
more prosperous under the new régime? Will
the people be able to rise to a higher level?
As I took leave of the spot, now so desolate,
where the mission settlement once stood, I
asked myself whether it would ever be rebuilt
and whether men would come forward to take
the place of those martyrs who had sacrificed
their life in the cause of the orphans and forsaken
children of China. Casting one last
lingering look upon the place, which I should
probably never see again, the dismal outline of
the ruined bell-tower seemed to rise up in
pathetic protest against human intolerance and
blind persecution.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p class="center">THE RETURN JOURNEY</p>

<p>The city of Mukden contained so much that
was of interest to me, that my stay there was
prolonged beyond my original intentions. The<span class="pagenum">[109]</span><a name="index109"></a>
Governor, to whom I had related all the difficulties
and discomforts of my journey, very
kindly placed a carriage at my disposal and gave
me an escort to see me safely back to the
station. But perilous as the outward journey
had been, the return was no less full of various
emotions.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful autumn day when I left
the town. Nature seemed to be making one
last effort to assert the power of her charms
before falling into her winter sleep. As we
passed through the precincts of the city, the
gardens literally glittered with colour. All
imaginable shades, from copper-tinted saffron
to bronzed purple, were there displayed. These
gardens are certainly most beautifully cultivated.
Presently we emerged into the open
plain, and now I had the opportunity, which
I had missed before, of forming some idea of
the fertility of this privileged land. Manchuria
is undoubtedly one of the richest countries
in the world. The soil is excellent, the
hills are thickly wooded, the mountains abound
in minerals. Along the route we passed farms
where maize and beans seemed to be chiefly
cultivated, and all the people, men, women,
and children, were at work in the field.</p>

<p>The landscape is rather monotonous. We
traversed a wide plain enclosed by mountains
which touch the horizon; but although the<span class="pagenum">[110]</span><a name="index110"></a>
scenery cannot be called picturesque, it is not
devoid of a certain grandeur. It has a charm
peculiar to itself, an atmosphere of vague
melancholy. All vast plains, those of Egypt
for instance, or of Rajputana, have this same
undefinable, intangible characteristic, of which
one is faintly conscious without being able to
describe it. The people who live in such a free
atmosphere are naturally affected by it, and
the Manchus possess all the characteristics of a
race inhabiting an exposed country.</p>

<p>The Manchu is attached to his native land;
he loves to live in the open, and is never so
happy as when galloping across the endless
plain or hunting in the virgin forests. As we
laboriously proceeded on the uneven road, my
fancy had full play, and I received new ideas
and impressions from these novel surroundings.
Since I had explored the interior of the country
more carefully, my ideas about Manchuria had
certainly undergone a great change. Every
now and then, however, my cogitations were
rudely interrupted as we jumped over ditches,
crawled up or ran down the inclines, and it
was a wonder that my poor <i>tarantass</i> was not
smashed in the attempt. It may be as well,
perhaps, to give some idea of what a <i>tarantass</i>
is like. Four small wheels, very far apart, and
joined by wooden axles, were fixed in the centre
to a long pole, on which the basket, in shape<span class="pagenum">[111]</span><a name="index111"></a>
something between a boat and a bath, was
fastened. The vibration of this pole takes the
place of springs, although it would be incorrect
to say that it performed the office of such civilized
improvements. But the pole kept the
wheels and the basket together, and this, after
all, is an accomplishment to be proud of on the
highroads of Asia. My carriage was not drawn
by mules this time, but I had three horses
harnessed abreast, in the Muscovite style.
They were small Cossack horses, with long manes
and tails, slightly larger than Shetland ponies,
strong and lively. The middle one was somewhat
bigger than the two others; it could trot,
while the ponies to the right and left of it had
to gallop all the time, their heads gracefully
arched and held a little to one side. The harness
was most eccentric, and consisted of straps
without number, the use of which it was difficult
to see, but the silver-nailed mountings, studded
in Eastern fashion, looked decidedly picturesque.</p>

<p>My coachman was a Cossack, and evidently
very much impressed with the importance of
his mission. About fifteen men formed the
escort, their white blouses and flat white caps
forming a striking feature in the landscape.
They are good-natured, simple-minded folk,
these mujiks, with bright blue eyes, clear complexion,
and a childlike expression. They are evidently
quite at home in this far-away country,<span class="pagenum">[112]</span><a name="index112"></a>
for the ways of life in their native land are
primitive and patriarchal, and differ but little
from those in this foreign land. It is
difficult to believe that these men can ever be
cruel, and in time of war commit the greatest
atrocities in cold blood and almost unconsciously.
When the war is over they at once
make friends with the conquered people, and
freely mix with the yellow tribes. A little
two-wheeled cart, containing provisions, and
with a young Cossack as driver, completed my
escort.</p>

<p>If I were asked what were the most striking
objects I passed on the road, I should mention
two pagodas, one of which is particularly beautiful,
seven storeys high, and richly carved.
Monsters of Chinese mythology and all the
embellishments which the sickly imagination
of that ancient race could devise, have been
lavishly represented upon it. We also passed
some remarkable commemorative stones&mdash;massive
blocks, resting on enormous tortoises&mdash;on
which are inscribed the exploits of the defunct
heroes of the country. The many farms on our
route testified to the agricultural resources of
the land, and the villages are not without interest
from a sociological point of view. The
houses are very shabby and dilapidated, but
what amused me was the number of children
there were playing about. There did not seem<span class="pagenum">[113]</span><a name="index113"></a>
to be room enough to contain them all, and there
were hardly any doors to be seen; the population
appears to jump out of the ground like
mushrooms. We met carts of various descriptions,
pedestrians, strange equipages, and
stranger horsemen, and to finish up with, a
mandarin travelling in state. This personage
was carried in a litter covered with embroidered
silk, and the luggage packed, in cases of wonderful
lacquer-work, was carried by his men on
their backs. Suite and servants followed him
in single file, and all the emblems of his
dignity, flags, Chinese lanterns, umbrellas, and
banners, with various inscriptions, were carried
before him. His Excellency was guarded by
a detachment of native soldiers, in crimson
mantles with lozenge-shaped pieces of velvet
let in at the front and back, and elaborately
embroidered with Chinese characters. Of
course, many of the details of this show were
very shabby. The canopy of the litter was
torn and faded, the velvet of the uniforms was
caked with mud, the banners were in rags,
and yet as a whole it was one of the most artistic
displays I have ever seen. Asiatics certainly
have the knack of making their pageants effective.
A mandarin of secondary order, visiting
a functionary about equal in rank to a tax-collector,
has an escort of followers and soldiers
amounting to several dozen men, while the<span class="pagenum">[114]</span><a name="index114"></a>
highest Western officials are content with two
footmen behind their carriage on grand occasions.</p>

<p>I have already said that the journey back to
Mukden station was no improvement on the
journey thence, and yet, as I write these lines,
seated in my comfortable railway carriage, my
adventure, now that it is a thing of the past,
seems like a dream to me. To make the story
more interesting I must begin at the end,
namely, with the dramatic incident of the journey,
and tell how we only just escaped being
kidnapped or possibly killed by a band of
brigands. Thanks to Providence, however, no
more serious harm was done to us than the fall
of the <i>tarantass</i> into the swollen river, a compulsory
bath in full uniform for some of the
Cossacks, various bruises and scratches, and
a broken litter. The intended attack was
changed into flight, and the tragedy turned into
a comedy, to the satisfaction of all. I will
briefly relate the facts.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the first village, the
Cossacks declared that the horses were thirsty,
and that a halt was therefore necessary. They
all dismounted and hurried into the wayside
inn, leaving me alone with the horses. But as
I could see neither well nor bucket, I could do
nothing for the poor beasts. After a while the
men returned, and there was no mistaking the<span class="pagenum">[115]</span><a name="index115"></a>
state of affairs. If the horses had had no water,
the men had found plenty to drink. Presently
we came to another village, and the same thing
occurred there, only this time they did not
trouble to invent any excuse, and never mentioned
the thirsty horses. I need hardly say
that after each halt the conversation waxed
more animated, and the horses were pushed on
more furiously. After the third stoppage the
situation became alarming. They no longer
talked, but all shouted at once, the clatter of
their voices being intermixed with snatches of
popular songs, while the trot of the horses
changed to a gallop.</p>

<p>I felt desperate, for I knew that I was quite
powerless against the inveterate national custom
of these children of nature. They continued,
however, to behave well towards me, and treated
me with the greatest respect. They were only
very hilarious, that was all. They shouted
and sang and waved their red kerchiefs as we
sped along.</p>

<p>The last hamlet passed, and there being no
further chance of obtaining refreshment until
Mukden station was reached, a steeplechase was
proposed across country, to the station. I cannot
tell what distance we thus covered, for the
speed at which we went exceeded all my previous
experiences. The race over the uneven
ground caused me many different sensations.<span class="pagenum">[116]</span><a name="index116"></a>
Across the plain it was rapid and exciting, and
I fully participated in the exhilaration of these
wild children. Across the cultivated ground
it was pleasant enough for those on horseback,
but to me, in my <i>tarantass</i>, it was like being on
the rack. But it was in crossing the maize-fields
that I suffered most.</p>

<p>The race increased in speed. Horses and
men completely lost their heads, and it was no
longer a question of restraining them. The
horses took the bits between their teeth and
simply went like the wind. We seemed to fly
over the ditches and tore through the reed
hedges. Some of the animals slipped and the
men fell head over heels in the mud, while guns
and swords described glittering circles in the
air. Finally, in trying to clear a deep creek,
one of the wheels of the provision-cart came off,
and all the contents were scattered. Then, to
my joy, I saw looming in the distance, like a
haven of refuge, the miserable shed which is
called Mukden station.</p>

<p>I lay down at the bottom of the <i>tarantass</i>,
with a feeling of deliverance near at hand. I
must explain that my straw seat had fallen to
pieces at an early stage of our mad race, so
that the only way to remain in the <i>tarantass</i>
was by lying down at the bottom and holding
on to the sides. But even this comparative
degree of comfort was extended to me for only<span class="pagenum">[117]</span><a name="index117"></a>
a short time, for suddenly I received a terrible
shock; there was a grinding noise produced
by the carriage, followed by an exclamation
from the driver, unintelligible to me; the sound
of horses struggling in the water; and finally I
felt an icy wave dashing over me. I thought
I was drowning, and instinctively raised myself
in my basket. We were in the middle of a
river which had overflowed its banks! My
little horses were half submerged. Some of the
Cossacks were still in the saddle; others
were wading through the muddy stream up to
their waists in water. They were all in a state
of great excitement, talking and shouting, but
all quite cheerful. Some were washing their
scratches, others struggling desperately to rescue
their belongings, which were floating away on
the stream, and the horses, at last, with supreme
contentment, were able to drink their fill of the
water so long withheld and so fully deserved.</p>

<p>The steeplechase under ordinary conditions
may be a noble sport and may have its charm
and many dangers, but it cannot be compared
with such a cross-country race in a <i>tarantass</i>,
escorted by a detachment of Cossacks. And
yet, in spite of all, I am indebted to these hardy
companions, for their mad escapade and their
wild merriment saved our lives. Whilst in full
career, with horses neighing, Cossacks shouting,
and swords flashing, we became aware of a body<span class="pagenum">[118]</span><a name="index118"></a>
of men, who had presumably been hiding in
the bushes, escaping towards the distant woods.
Evidently they thought we were pursuing them,
and they fled in disorder. I learnt afterwards
that it was a band of those Chunchuses who
have been the terror of the district for many
years, and very likely the same I met on my
previous journey. Not long ago they kidnapped
Mr. Wetzel, the director of the East China Railway,
whose adventures have been described at
length in the newspapers. He was carried into
the interior, underwent the most terrible tortures,
and was on the verge of losing his mind when
his ransom arrived.</p>

<p>If my Cossacks had not indulged in that
steeplechase my journey might have had a
tragic ending. Thanks to our furious riding,
we startled the band lying in wait for a prey;
but if they had seen us quietly proceeding like
ordinary travellers along the highroad, they
would undoubtedly have attacked us; and I will
therefore conclude with the well-known proverb:
"All's well that ends well."</p>

<p class="center "><b>PORT ARTHUR, DALNY, NIU-CHWANG,
TIEN-TSIN</b></p>


<p>The country between Mukden and Port
Arthur is the granary of Manchuria. Rice,
corn, and maize grow in great profusion, and
there are from thirty-five to forty different kinds
of peas and beans. Chinese agriculture is based
on excellent principles. The system of irrigation
and the methods of working fully deserve
our attention; but the plentiful harvests are
chiefly due to the remarkable mode of manuring.
The same piece of ground can yield several crops
in rotation in one year. It would seem that the
land never requires to lie fallow.</p>

<p>As I watched the Chinese farmers and
labourers, I was vividly struck by the contrast
between this peace-loving, agricultural population,
and the armed Cossacks who lined the
route. The nearer we came to the coast the
more numerous they seemed to become, and
there were more and larger barracks also. Yet
the Russian military and the Chinese farmers
appear to live on friendly terms with one another.
I frequently saw Russian soldiers and Chinamen
sitting at the same table, merrily talking together,<span class="pagenum">[120]</span><a name="index120"></a>
and I even noticed signs of Russification
among the natives, for many pigtails were
twisted up and hidden under a Russian <i>schapka</i>.
They eat the same food with an equally good
appetite, and appear to have many tastes in
common. If, during the Boxer agitation, the
Russian troops behaved with exceptional cruelty
towards the natives, it is certain that at present
there is a perfect understanding between them.
And after all they belong more or less to the
same stock; their historic past is very similar,
and they both live the same primitive life.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>I was now nearing the end of my journey,
and although the progress had been slow it had
been full of incidents. The last obstacle on the
route we encountered at Liaoyang, where a
bridge had been swept away. I was prepared
for this delay, for some weeks before, the station-master
at Harbin had given me a thrilling
account of the accident. I remember wondering
at the time whether he was exaggerating
and trying to dissuade me from penetrating
further into the interior of Manchuria; but when
I saw the state of affairs at Liaoyang I realized
that his story had been perfectly true. The
scene before me was one of general confusion.
Thousands of Russian soldiers and Chinese
coolies were engaged in carting sand, cutting
poles, and fixing rails; all talking and shouting<span class="pagenum">[121]</span><a name="index121"></a>
at once in different tongues and dialects.</p>

<p>It was a veritable babel. About a thousand
men were occupied in constructing a bridge of
stone and iron. A few thousand others were
throwing up sandbanks to check the water,
while another gang of workmen was making a
pontoon. We stopped several hours and no
one seemed to know how or when we should
get across. But the scene was so exciting, and
gave me such an excellent opportunity of watching
the Chinese at work, that I did not grudge
the delay. At last some engineering officers
suggested dividing the train and trying to take
it across by the pontoon in portions.</p>

<p>How it was exactly managed I am unable to
describe, for what with the jerking and bumping
of my carriage, and the whistling, creaking, and
groaning of the engine over the swaying pontoon,
I had no chance of making observations. And
when the temporary rails over the pontoon
became submerged and the waves dashed up
to my carriage door, I followed the example of
the stoker and the guard and stood on the step,
barefooted, ready to jump and attempt to swim
to land if the whole tottering structure should
collapse and disappear under the waves.</p>

<p>Thus ended my journey across Manchuria.
Many delays and excursions into the interior
had retarded my progress, but at last I arrived
safe and sound at Port Arthur, where I remained<span class="pagenum">[122]</span><a name="index122"></a>
two days, including a visit to Dalny. Port
Arthur, as I saw it, was merely a military station
on the extremity of the peninsula of Liaotung.
At one time it was the chief naval arsenal of
China, but after the war with Japan its defences
and military works were destroyed. When, in
1898, the Russians leased the two places, Port
Arthur and Dalny, they made the former into a
great military and naval fortress. It was placed
under the control of an admiral who had chief
command over the troops and the maritime
forces. He had under him a double staff of
naval and military officers, comprising the
commander of the port, the chiefs of the naval
staff, the riflemen, the artillery, the engineering
service, and the intelligence department, the
harbour master, the chief of the torpedo division,
the first assistant to the commander of
the port, the second assistant, the commander
of the commercial port, the ordnance officers of
the Governor-General, the civil governor, the
diplomatic agent, the secretary of finances, and
the chief of the police.</p>

<p>Port Arthur undoubtedly has a very complicated
form of administration, and at first it
was suggested that it should be made into an
eastern Kronstadt, or the Asiatic citadel of the
great empire. The place itself and the surrounding
hills are full of fortifications, and I have been
assured over and over again that it would be perfectly<span class="pagenum">[123]</span><a name="index123"></a>
impossible to take it by sea. It is one long
line of arsenals, torpedo depots, barracks, and
encampments. The fact that Port Arthur is
essentially a military port is not disguised;
there are only a few buildings, including those
of the East China Railway Company and the
Russo-Chinese Bank, which do not openly serve
military purposes.</p>

<p>A new town has grown up on the opposite
side to satisfy the demands of trade. This is
called Dalny, and is situated on the bay of
Talienwan, to the north-west of Port Arthur.
The territory, like that of Port Arthur, was
given in lease by China, and it is intended to
make this into a free port connected by the
Manchurian Railway with Vladivostok, Moscow,
the Black Sea, and the Baltic. It might
in time become the great commercial centre of
the extreme East. The port is about six miles
long and very deep, and offers exceptional
facilities for navigation.</p>

<p>Dalny in its present condition has a somewhat
paradoxical aspect. Palaces emerge from the
sands, public monuments fill the deserted squares,
avenues and boulevards are traced out on the
shore. Dalny is the hope of the partisans of
Russian commerce and progress, while Port
Arthur is the pride of the military party. The
development of the former is encouraged by the
energetic efforts of Mr. White; the latter finds<span class="pagenum">[124]</span><a name="index124"></a>
a powerful protector in General Kuropatkin.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_124.jpg" alt="General Kuropatkin" />
<p class="caption">GENERAL KUROPATKIN<br />
[To face page 124]</p></div>

<p>Port Arthur impressed me greatly on account
of its strategic importance, but what I saw of
Dalny did not inspire me with much confidence
as to its commercial future. During my visit
I saw all that has been accomplished since 1898,
and certainly, although many things are still
far from perfect, and the mistakes made are
very palpable even to the uninitiated, one cannot
fail to recognize that much has been done
in so short a time. But if we knew at what
cost all this has been accomplished, our admiration
would probably be considerably reduced.</p>

<p>No boat for Taku was likely to start for some
time, so I decided to continue my journey to
Pekin by rail. As far as Ying-tsé we travelled
over the main Manchurian line, whence a branch
line runs to Niu-chwang. This is the most
northerly port of the Yellow Empire open
to foreign trade. It is situated at a distance
of thirteen miles from the mouth of the river
Liao, which discharges into the gulf of Liaotung,
a continuation of the gulf of Pechili.
The railway line, which brings Niu-chwang into
direct communication with Siberia and Pekin,
was just finished. Branch lines in the direction
of Tien-tsin had existed before this, but they
were destroyed in the late Boxer troubles.
To give my readers a somewhat accurate idea
of the importance of this town I will try to<span class="pagenum">[125]</span><a name="index125"></a>
quote from the Official journals:&mdash;</p>

<p>The town of Niu-chwang is rapidly growing
in importance since the construction of the railway.
The East China Railway between Port
Arthur, Dalny, and the junction of Ta-shik-chia,
whence a branch line runs to Port Arthur,
was finished as far as Mukden towards the close
of 1899. The Chinese Imperial line was also
completed then. It was subsequently decided
to deal systematically with the mineral resources
of Manchuria, owing to the East China line
having laid open the coal-mines at Mochi-Shan
and Z'mershan near the Liaoyang, and at
Wafungtien in the south of the Liaotung peninsula.
The railway line runs right along these
rich exploitations. An unprecedented commercial
activity has accompanied these developments,
resulting in an increase of 49 per cent.
for 1898.</p>

<p>The chief articles of trade for this port are
beans and oil-cake, with an export of 2,241,053
piculs of the former and 2,289,544 piculs of the
latter in 1899. The net quantity of opium imported
in 1898 was 92 piculs as against 2453 in
1879. The importation of opium has been
steadily declining in the course of the last few
years, the poppy seed being largely and successfully
cultivated in Manchuria. The total figure
of the trade of this port for 1899 has risen to
48,357,623 taels as against 32,441,315 in 1898.<span class="pagenum">[126]</span><a name="index126"></a>
The port figured conspicuously in the disturbances
of 1900; the Chinese troops which
attacked the town being defeated by the Russians,
who took possession of the port. Trade
was necessarily at a standstill in 1900.</p>

<p>Niu-chwang was a revelation to me. I saw
for the first time a real Chinese town in all its
immensity. It appeared an inextricable labyrinth
of streets and alleys overflowing with
people. All our Western ideas are reversed
here; indeed, buildings and people alike seemed
to belong not only to another hemisphere, but
to another planet. The lines are so strange,
the colours so brilliant, the sounds so sharp,
that one is at once deafened, blinded, and
astonished. Beyond the city, on the solid
earth, is the floating town on the river. The
Liao at this point, little more than half a mile
wide, is literally covered with vessels of every
description.</p>

<p>It is a thronged mass of large merchant ships,
smaller boats, and wooden junks. Each boat
is a home, in which always one, and often several,
families are housed with all their belongings:
children, pigs, and poultry filling the decks.
Those of the better classes who can afford it
have regular summer-houses on the river, built
like pagodas, elaborately furnished and surrounded
by artificial gardens with dwarf trees
in costly pots. In between this confusion of<span class="pagenum">[127]</span><a name="index127"></a>
boats, narrow passages and regular canals are
left free on the water, in which graceful canoes
are seen gliding and winding about like gondolas.
Both on land and water, the crowds of
human beings, and exuberance of life, are overwhelming.</p>

<p>One feels ill at ease and lost among this surging
mass of humanity. The narrowest streets
and the largest squares, the courts and the floating
houses, all teem with life; and, in contrast
with the sleepy, passive multitudes of India,
all are active here, from the youngest to the
oldest. All seem intent on their business, all
appear to have some strenuous end in view.
The capacity for work which this race possesses
manifests itself everywhere from morning till
night. Chinese strength and vitality are here
seen in all their original energy and force.</p>

<p>Niu-chwang is an important place even now,
but it has every possibility and likelihood of
becoming one of the great commercial centres
of the future. Its international trade has been
hitherto hindered by the fact that the river is
frozen for three months in the year, but since
the completion of the Tien-tsin line the town has
become easy of access by land. A railway
bridge over the Liao is projected, and when this
is built the train will run directly from Pekin to
St. Petersburg. At present travellers have to
cross the river in wooden junks, and continue<span class="pagenum">[128]</span><a name="index128"></a>
their journey by the Chinese trains.</p>

<p>In the centre of the commercial town is the
settlement of the Catholic Mission. Buried in
a maze of tortuous streets, it is almost lost sight
of in the bustle and noise of the adjacent
fair, giving the impression of some Oriental
bazaar. The little church, and the few small
houses belonging to the Mission, are enclosed
as far as possible by a whitewashed garden
wall, which is but a poor protection in case
of siege or serious disorders. If the populace
were to show signs of hostility that ruinous
wall would not hold out long against the mob;
but they who join the Mission, who devote
their lives to deeds of charity, who feed the
starving, and care for the destitute, put their
trust in a defence stronger than the strongest
towers of this world. From the time that the
missionary leaves his native land and offers his
life to the Almighty, he spends his days in
a constant state of uncertainty. From the
moment that he sets foot on the shores of
the Yellow Empire dangers of all kinds crowd
around him. These martyrs to duty are
continuously exposed to open and secret
persecution, terrible epidemics, privations, and
hardships of all kinds. Yet in spite of manifold
trials and dangers, young priests and
nuns who have only just taken the vow, go
over to the Far East, happy and full of zeal, ready<span class="pagenum">[129]</span><a name="index129"></a>
to devote their lives to the noble spiritual work.</p>

<p>On the day of my departure from Niu-chwang
I had the good fortune to witness an historical
event, the official transfer of the railway to the
Chinese Governor-General of Manchuria. Since
the last war the route between Niu-chwang and
Hankau-chwang had been under the military
control of Russia, while the other route between
the latter town and Tien-tsin was held by
British troops. There were great festivities in
honour of the day. The station buildings were
decorated with all the pomp of Asiatic taste;
everywhere Venetian masts, floating banners,
Chinese inscriptions, and Russian trophies,
announced the great event, with laurel garlands
symbolizing victory, and olive branches speaking
of eternal peace. Ambitious mandarins and
gold-bedizened Russian generals exchanged
salutes and bows in sign of mutual respect. No
doubt it was a case of "live and let live," for
all appeared quite satisfied.</p>

<p>An interminable programme marked the order
of the festivities, and if I had had an aptitude
for journalism I could have written columns
upon "The Official Transfer of the East China
Railway Line by Russia to China." I could
have indulged in lengthy descriptions of the
receptions, presentations, floral offerings, banquets,
with streams of champagne, and endless
flow of toasts. But the best correspondent<span class="pagenum">[130]</span><a name="index130"></a>
could not have said more than I have done here
upon the principal event, the actual transfer of
the railway. He could not have pierced, any
more than I could, that thick veil which hides
from us the knowledge as to whether that railway
has actually become Chinese property or not.</p>

<p>The country between Niu-chwang and Hankau-chwang
is at first flat and uninteresting, although
rich in vegetation. Nearer to the sea it becomes
more varied, and in parts it is quite picturesque.
Some of the bays of the Yellow Sea&mdash;which,
by the by, is intensely blue just there&mdash;resemble
the fjords and are dominated by craggy rocks.
We advanced slowly and stopped at many
stations, the Russian soldiers still always predominating
over the native contingent.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening, when our train,
with much noise, passed through the breach in
the famous wall, by which I was greatly impressed.
That enormous mass of masonry, one
of the most colossal structures ever made by
human hands, is here seen to the best advantage,
skirting the steep inclines of the mountains,
ascending to the tops of the highest peaks, or
descending into the plains to lose itself finally
in the unfathomable depths of the sea.</p>

<p>It is indeed a wonderful sight, and, like that
other gigantic human undertaking, the Pyramids
of Egypt, this wall is interesting, not only for
its own sake, but also as marking a stage in the<span class="pagenum">[131]</span><a name="index131"></a>
history of the civilization of the world. I gazed
at it, and looked at our powerful engine, with its
long train of American-built carriages, as it
passed through the breach, and in that one
glance there was much to comprehend both
from the past and for the future of Asia.</p>

<p>At Hankau-chwang a surprise awaited me.
The English troops had finished their mission,
and on this momentous occasion the commander
gave a dinner. The guests were assembled in
the little yamen near the station. The dining-room
was tastefully draped and hung with
pretty watercolours. Books and knick-knacks
lay about, and the table was covered with an
immaculately white cloth and set out with a
dinner-service of severe simplicity, but scrupulously
clean. A simple abode it was, but every
detail of it would bring to temporary inmates the
pleasant recollections of the comforts and the
charm of their English homes.</p>

<p>Another interesting stage of my journey was
from Hankau-chwang to Tien-tsin, through one of
the richest districts of China. Our train stopped
frequently, for we touched many important
towns. Trade is brisk in this part. In places
the ground was cultivated like a vegetable
garden, but the real wealth of the district lies
in its coal-mines. In the way of structural
curiosities the two chief sites on the road were
the country house of Li Hung-Chang and Fort<span class="pagenum">[132]</span><a name="index132"></a>
Taku.</p>

<p>The late Viceroy and great politician had also
been a clever financier. His weakness for speculation
and commercial enterprise was well-known
throughout the country. The coal-mines
of this neighbourhood were partly his property.
He not only looked well after his personal
affairs, but also took care to inquire into the
financial position of those with whom he dealt.
Whenever he entertained a foreign diplomatist,
or granted an interview to the director of some
international company, or even the head of
some ordinary business house desirous of gaining
information about special concessions or
privileges, the first question the Viceroy asked
invariably was: "What is he worth? How
rich is he?" The success of a petition depended,
so I was told, to a great extent upon the sum of
money poured into the coffers of the statesman
as a preliminary investment.</p>

<p>Fort Taku does not need to be described at
length. It has played a conspicuous part in
the history of the last five-and-twenty years&mdash;in
the struggles between the West and the East,
the White and the Yellow races. It has been
several times bombarded, destroyed, and rebuilt.
At present it is again in ruins.</p>

<p>There is now a new commercial town in
course of erection. In the place of the old-world
style, modern colonists have introduced<span class="pagenum">[133]</span><a name="index133"></a>
a somewhat vulgar and insipid form of architecture,
which possesses neither the picturesqueness
of the old Chinese towns nor the advantages
of our European cities. The colony is as yet
in its infancy, and only counts a few rows of
small houses and some miserable shops.</p>

<p>The last stopping-place on my journey was
Tien-tsin. Situated on the crossing of the Peiho
and the Grand Canal, this is one of the most
important towns of China. It has a population
of over a million, and is divided into the city
proper, the foreign confines, and the suburbs.
The old part is a perfect specimen of a Chinese
town, overpopulated, brilliant, noisy, and dirty;
a hustling, bustling crowd of humanity living
like bees in a hive. It contains many interesting
monuments, although the chief attraction of
the city no longer exists, I mean its enclosure,
the wall which surrounded a square of four
thousand feet. It was pulled down to make
room for trade traffic.</p>

<p>The European quarter is very different in
character; it has large squares, shady avenues,
and beautiful buildings. Each nation represented
there has a little colony of its own, with
barracks, commercial offices, and consular residences.
The English colony, which is close to the
French, boasts of the best buildings, has large,
well-kept streets, and is guarded by some very
fine-looking Sikhs. The large dwelling-houses,<span class="pagenum">[134]</span><a name="index134"></a>
the homely bungalows, and the turbaned figures
of the tall soldiers, remind one of some Indian
cantonment. The Italian and Austrian quarters
are on the other side of the canal, and almost
lost among the native town. Since the occupation
of the Allied Troops the importance of
Tien-tsin has grown considerably, and in time it
is likely to become a powerful rival to Shanghai
as far as international commercial interests are
concerned. In fact, it has all the commercial
advantages of Shanghai. When we consider
that at the time of the Ming dynasty it occupied
only a secondary position, its development is
the more remarkable. Tien-tsin is about eighty
miles distant from Pekin, and lies near the sea;
its commercial advantages as the market for
export and import trade are therefore evident.</p>

<p>The railway has added another considerable
advantage to the many already possessed by
Tien-tsin, namely that of bringing it into direct
communication with the mainland. Li Hung-Chang,
who, in his capacity of Viceroy, resided
there for many years, was a strong supporter of
the place. Under him it became, not only a large
commercial centre, but with the normal schools
for the organization of army and navy, other
elements were attracted towards the place, and
different occupations introduced.</p>

<p>Tien-tsin, in fact, has become the home of the
progressive party. Pamphlets, daily papers,<span class="pagenum">[135]</span><a name="index135"></a>
literary and political clubs, have propagated the
views and ideas of the great Viceroy. It was
Li Hung-Chang who started the first coal-pit
in the neighbourhood of Tong-shan, about
thirty years ago, and the export of coal is
making rapid progress. The output amounts at
present to nearly three hundred thousand tons.
Another local industry of great importance is
the production of salt. This is a Government
monopoly, and is obtained through the evaporation
of sea-water. The salt lies piled up in heaps
along the banks of the river. Spirituous liquors
are distilled in large quantities and sent into the
interior. The exports include wines, furs, skins,
bristles, and wood. Export trade, which did
not exist five-and-twenty years ago, now reaches
a total of about fifteen million taels per annum.</p>

<p>From the time of the first European expedition
in 1858, Tien-tsin has been the scene of
much fighting and many desperate battles.
During the last rebellion the disturbances were
greater there than anywhere else, and it was
there also that the Boxers, in the beginning of
June, 1900, set fire to the Foreign Mission
settlements. At first no one seemed to realize
the imminence of the danger, and it was not
until the second half of the same month, after
the bombardment of Taku, that hostilities,
attended with all the horrors of war, were
seriously commenced. The attack on the European<span class="pagenum">[136]</span><a name="index136"></a>
colony, the blockade of the barracks, the
destruction of the railway station, and the
massacre of the missionaries and Christians,
followed each other rapidly. Eye-witnesses
have given us graphic descriptions of the atrocities
committed during the insurrection. The
bravery of the troops, the missionaries, the
Christian women, and the children, has excited
the admiration of the world. Many ruins still
testify to this prolonged siege.</p>

<p>The chief event of my stay in this place was
my visit to the Viceregal Palace. If Li Hung-Chang
had been a great statesman, his successor
was not unworthy of him. Yuan-tsi-Khai and
Chan-chi-Tung are the two most prominent men
of modern China. Nature has endowed them
very differently, but they are alike zealous
in their endeavours to rouse China from its
apathy. Although the ways and means by
which they hope to effect their object are different,
the end in view is the same. Chan-chi-Tung
is a peace-loving man, an ardent follower
of the doctrine of Confucius, and strongly
attached to the national principles of morality.
He favours reform in undertakings of a purely
commercial and industrial nature, in financial
transactions; but in intellectual and spiritual
questions he is very conservative. In his own
province he has made successful attempts at
improvement. He has established factories,<span class="pagenum">[137]</span><a name="index137"></a>
cotton mills and looms, forges, local railways,
and an important arsenal on the Yangtse-kiang.</p>

<p>His adversaries&mdash;and he has many, like every
one who rises above the common level&mdash;accuse
him of being an idealist. But in most cases his
ideas, practically carried out, have proved to be
of very real benefit to his country. He is a
deep thinker and a most pleasant and interesting
companion. His writings on various political
and social questions are fine specimens of human
philosophy.</p>

<p>Yuan-tsi-Khai is, on the contrary, before all
a man of action, a soldier at heart. He loves to
fight his enemies and to press forward without
considering the difficulties in the way.</p>

<p>My sojourn at Tien-tsin was of special service
to me in obtaining clearer ideas as to the actual
conditions of China. I made the acquaintance
of many interesting persons, some of whom are
the makers of the history of our time. They
were not all of the same nationality, nor did
they all pursue the same vocation, nor were
they all of the same mind; their opinions also
were widely different. But it is to a certain
extent owing to the antagonism of their views
that I was enabled to form some provisional
conclusions.</p>

<p>It was on a bright afternoon of the short
St. Martin's summer that I accomplished the
last twenty-four miles of my long railway journey<span class="pagenum">[138]</span><a name="index138"></a>
across the two continents. As I neared my
final destination, Pekin, and passed through the
flat and barren country I could hardly realize
that I had traversed such an enormous distance
during the last few months. I tried to recall to
mind the different countries I had passed through
and their inhabitants, the prosperous towns and
the miserable villages I had visited; the centres
of civilization and the primitive solitudes.</p>

<p>Then I began to comprehend all I had
seen. Much of my previous conceptions of
this part of the world had been vague, for the
difference between what one imagines and what
actually is, is great! One may gather the
most reliable information, listen to the most
explicit descriptions, or study the best books,
but how far all this falls short of personal
experience! The best references, the most
accurate figures, the most lucid writings, will
never produce the same effect as reality, and it
is not upon those somewhat abstract notions
that our faculties are exercised with the greatest
profit. What one feels has even more weight
than what one sees, and psychological studies
are of greater value than statistics. To know
a country, it is the life, the everyday existence,
of its inhabitants that we have to study. Life
in all its varied expressions, in labour and in
rest, in its fundamental principles and its manifold
manifestations, this it is which reveals to us<span class="pagenum">[139]</span><a name="index139"></a>
the deep source from which the energizing elements
flow in diverse directions.</p>

<p>It was growing dark as we neared the end of
our journey. On the platforms of the small
stations we passed, I saw foreign soldiers belonging
to the Allied Forces; here fair Teuton giants,
there short, brown <i>bersaglieri</i>. And at each
succeeding station there was more movement,
more confusion, till we reached the metropolis.
The sun was setting as we skirted the imperial
deer park. Every moment the light effects increased
in beauty. The sombre masses of
foliage, framed by the blue lines of the eastern
hills, formed an enchanting picture.</p>

<p>Outlines and colours were so unexpected, so
strangely blended, that it looked like a painting
from the magic brush of some great Chinese
master. The forests stood out dark and
menacing, as if still sheltering the monsters and
dragons of ancient folk-lore, and the hills were
like so many pointed sugar-loaves, heaped up
by some awful giants.</p>

<p>It was as perfect a Chinese landscape as I
could have wished to see, and to crown all, the
sun went down in a blaze of light; it was as if
fiery darts were being shot across the flaming
sky. I have seen many sunsets in the tropics,
and in the East, but never anything to equal
this. The brightness of it flooded with saffron
the clouds of dust always hanging over the<span class="pagenum">[140]</span><a name="index140"></a>
capital, and illumined all the million atoms
which rise from the Mongolian desert....</p>

<p>At an unexpected turn in the road it seemed
as if the golden veil was torn aside to give me a
glimpse of the mysterious city. The stage effect
was perfect; the curtain might have been drawn
by a clever manager's hand to reveal the great
Hatamen Gate in all its magnificence. The
famous crenellated walls; the lofty towers and
proud pagodas, first described by Marco Polo; the
heavy bastions, and the marble bridges, were but
indistinctly visible, and therefore all the more
suggestive and beautiful. In fact, my first impression
of Pekin was of a fancy or dream. What
the city really looked like was as yet mercifully
hidden from me; my imagination could have full
play, untrammelled by the disillusions of knowledge
and experience. Afterwards I saw things
differently, but that first day the great city of
the mighty Khan seemed as a mirage to me.</p>

<p>The crumbling citadel of a great nation,
nay, of the whole glory of a mighty race, the
monument of its art, the Walhalla of its history,
shone in the dazzling splendour of the afterglow,
like a golden city floating on golden
clouds.</p>

<p class="center"><b>PEKIN</b></p>


<p class="center">I<br />
THE ARRIVAL</p>

<p>It is evening when I arrive in Pekin. The
train stops outside the Tartar Wall. Darkness
shrouds everything, and the place seems to
be deserted. Not even a guard or porter is to
be seen. Alongside the embankment a few
coolies with gigantic lanterns are waiting for the
passengers, and, in quaint procession, with innumerable
balloons hanging from long bamboo
sticks, are searching for their masters. They
all shout, but no one seems to understand them.
There is no trace of any vehicles or carriages,
and I don't see even a platform. I am standing
in the midst of a desert; behind me, some sandhills
and a pool are all I can distinguish, and in
front, among the crowd of coolies, a tall figure
is conspicuous, which approaches, and, by the
yellow rays of a pumpkin-like lantern, I recognize
an old acquaintance. Here he occupies the
position of First Secretary of Legation, and
brings me an invitation from his chief. My
trunks are taken in charge by an attendant, and
we walk towards my new abode, which my friend<span class="pagenum">[142]</span><a name="index142"></a>
tells me is close by.</p>

<p>It is explained to me that the present railway
station is only a temporary one; only since the
occupation by the Allied Forces have trains been
able to penetrate as far as the inner wall. They
used to have to stop miles away, as no engine
was allowed to desecrate the holy city of Pekin.
At a short distance from the temporary station
is a tunnel-like opening in the wall, and I am
informed that it was made for the use of members
of the legations and foreign settlement,
and has ex-territorial rights granted to it. I
pass through the so-called Gate of the Nations
full of expectation, for I am most anxious for
surprises, which certainly are not wanting.</p>

<p>I hope to see before me a fairy city and scenes
like those on the stage; but instead of splendour
and glitter I see mist. By the flickering light
of a few paraffin lamps I begin to distinguish
the famous international quarter, but I feel it
would be better if they were not lit, for they only
disclose ruins and débris. Among heaps of
bricks and mortar we reach the edge of a ditch
of stagnant water, which, as my companion informs
me, not without some pride, is the so-called
Canal of Jade. It is a magnificent name,
which I have known for a long time. If I have
pictured it to myself as different from what it is
in reality, it is not the fault of an exaggerated
fancy; and as we stumble along in the lane<span class="pagenum">[143]</span><a name="index143"></a>
skirting the ditch&mdash;I beg its pardon; on the
banks of the waters of Jasper&mdash;I still cannot
perceive anything else but garden walls. I don't
even see the famous Jade Stream, for though
long ago there may have been water in the ditch,
there are now only puddles here and there. But
if I can't see, I smell all the more; smell all kinds
of unimaginable and imaginable odours.</p>

<p>At last we approach a gate with a martial
sentry in front of it. The password is given,
and we are at last at home. In the courtyard,
on the edge of the grass, are a number of lanterns.
Large and yellow, they look like melons.
The effect is charming, but as they give but very
indifferent light, I can only distinctly discern
some pillars and arches. Now we pass through
some open halls and reach a garden-like square.
To the right and left from the windows of small
summer-houses the light of candles filters through.
In front is another building in the same style,
a few columns supporting a heavy roof; the
columns are of red lacquered wood, and the tiles
of emerald-green. Beyond this is another garden,
and lastly the legation proper. The door
is open and the hall ablaze with light. On the
broad staircase are servants in red&mdash;pigtailed
Chinese, dressed after the fashion of their country.
They salute us, bowing low, with their
hands folded.</p>

<p>The scene is interesting, the setting fine. By<span class="pagenum">[144]</span><a name="index144"></a>
the light of the lanterns the roof of the old
yamen appears even more gabled than it is,
and its eaves the more bizarre than in reality.
At last I have before me a truly Chinese picture,
thousands of years old, artistic and brilliant.
But the scene quickly changes as we go inside, and
from the past we come to the present, from Oriental
surroundings we step into a Western interior.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>The rays of the rising sun wake me as they
burst brightly into the courtyard of the yamen,
filtering, rosy-coloured, through the embrasures
of the crenellated walls.</p>

<p>My quarters have a verandah looking upon a
small courtyard, the pillars of which are of ruby
lacquer, its roof of emerald glaze. In the yard
are many flowers planted in old china vases.
Four cedars, ages old, stand in the corners, and
their branches form a lovely shady tent under
the canopy of a morning sky. The branches
of the old trees and the eaves are swarming
with birds which awake with me, and merry
with their songs.</p>

<p>On opening my eyes I scarcely know whether
I am awake or still dreaming. It takes me some
time to realize my surroundings. In the little
garden some one is noiselessly crossing the grass
in paper shoes. He wears a light blue kaftan
over a white tunic, and the colours harmonize<span class="pagenum">[145]</span><a name="index145"></a>
well, for this slate-blue suits his yellow complexion,
and a long pigtail hangs down his back.</p>

<p>This is reality. I am indeed in the Flowery
Land. I am actually awaking in Pekin.</p>


<p class="center">II<br />
THE FIRST DRIVE THROUGH THE TOWN</p>

<p>It is eight o'clock in the evening. I have just
returned from Pei-tang; it takes nearly an hour
to come from there. And what a road! Imagine
a brilliant stereoscope with living figures
rushing forward upon you as you gaze&mdash;a gigantic
kaleidoscope in which, among multitudinous
and dazzling fragments a heap of ants are busy.
And if we look at these through a magnifying
glass, the effect will be somewhat similar to one's
first impression of Pekin. Bedlam, uproar,
chaos; and all this half concealed by a veil of
whirling dust. It would be difficult to recount
what I have seen, and even more difficult to
explain what my sensations were. I was amazed
by the brilliant spectacle.</p>

<p>It is early in the morning when I set out on
my exploring expedition. From the street in
which the legation stands we suddenly turn
into the grand Imperial Square. The yellow-roofed
palace in front of us may be called the
focus of Pekin, nay, the centre of the whole
Yellow Empire, for every road leads thither.</p>

<p>The principal street is broad, crossing the<span class="pagenum">[146]</span><a name="index146"></a>
wall of the Tartar city. A few miles farther to
the south it strikes the Chinese town, and through
gates like triumphal arches, and over bridges,
across moats, and skirting bastions, reaches the
open. This is the perspective before me: my
eyes penetrate in a straight line, almost any
distance, to the sea at the farthermost point of
the realm, but the crowd is so dense and the
traffic so thick, and there are such clouds of
dust, that we can hardly see what is going on
within a yard of us. Caravans of camels,
people on horseback, carriages, and carts follow
each other incessantly. Every moment we
narrowly escape a collision. It is a wonder
that numbers of the shaky little vehicles do not
get smashed, for there is a continuous stream of
fresh phantom-like objects.</p>

<p>The palace is surrounded by a high wall
painted red, and roofed with yellow tiles. Red
likewise is the large gate studded with yellow
nails. In fact, there are three gates side by
side&mdash;in China everything is threefold&mdash;but they
are all closed. In front of them are sentries, for
the palace is sacred, and entrance into it means
decapitation. On the other side are small shops
and stores, in the windows of which are exhibited
motley wares, while the façades are carved with
a hundred and one very quaint pictures. What
they represent I am at a loss to know.</p>

<p>We escape into one of the many side streets.<span class="pagenum">[147]</span><a name="index147"></a>
It is narrow, dark, and seems to be endless,
running along between the houses like a river,
to right and left.</p>

<p>Now we reach something like a desert. I
cannot call it a common, because there is no
grass; there is nothing but dust and dirt. Farther
away are some ruins, and still farther a
red wall can be seen. It is again the wall of the
Imperial city, that gigantic structure that follows
us wherever we go. It is either in front of
us or behind us, on one side or the other. Beyond
the wilderness are rows of houses. Behind
huge walls the tops of some shadowy trees are
visible now and again, the gabled roofs of
yamens and a few flagstaffs.</p>

<p>A little more wilderness is followed by a few
rows of houses, and beyond them come some
streets; shops crowded with customers, and,
lastly, the ubiquitous red wall again.</p>

<p>In the middle of the wall is the gate, a wooden
structure, with gabled towers and aggressively
golden dragons painted on it, and little bells
hanging down from the corners. Crowds are
streaming from the archway; sunburnt coolies
endeavouring to get their light carts over the
marble steps. Now we face the broad Imperial
street. The shops on both sides are still more
carved and gilt than the others. The gables are
like umbrellas blown inside out by the wind, and
the edges do not lack ornament, being decorated<span class="pagenum">[148]</span><a name="index148"></a>
with carved tassels and lace and every conceivable
trimming. The signboards are well worth
studying. Some are of wood, others of metal,
cast iron, or paper; but all display glaring colours.
No wonder they attract the attention of passersby.
The shoemakers' wooden signs are of unusually
large size, showing the latest fashion in
foot-gear either painted or carved, and apparently
floating in the clouds or in higher spheres. The
sign is generally suspended in the claws of some
grinning monster or lion by a chain that is
fastened to the eaves. Next in point of merit
are the signs of the Pekin apothecaries, who in
this respect decidedly excel us; and the pawnbrokers'
symbols deserve even more attention
than the others from an artistic point of view.</p>

<p>The pavement is occupied by stalls and booths,
their only protection from the sun being a sheet
of canvas fixed to a pole. The wares are spread
out on the ground. Street kitchens abound,
consisting of little earthenware stoves or small
iron grates which are used for cooking. Half-naked
workmen are huddled round the tables,
which are covered with little mugs about as
large as teacups, each containing something
different, hundreds of delicacies with sauces
both bitter and sweet at once. Long thin sticks
are used instead of forks, and the skill shown in
the handling of them is simply astonishing. I have
never seen people eat more daintily. A dinner<span class="pagenum">[149]</span><a name="index149"></a>
of eight or nine courses can be had for about one
farthing. With their chopsticks they pick out
some of the solid dishes, seasoning them with
four or five different sauces. The Chinese are
the greatest gourmets in the world, for I notice
that the ordinary meals of labourers are more
complicated than the choicest menu of a French
chef.</p>

<p>The end of the street is enclosed by a wall&mdash;the
usual red wall&mdash;the inner defence of the
Imperial city. Here stands the Western Gate,
and the monumental quarter, with yellow tiled
roofs, begins. In front of it is a sentry, the entrance
to the garden being strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>My way is not in that direction, but to the
north. In the centre of the park, which has
recently been replanted, stands the cathedral,
finished a few months ago.</p>

<p>The work of the Chinese Missions is written
on one of the latest pages of universal history.
The events of two years ago are still vividly
impressed on our memories, when the few hundred
Christians who had sought refuge at the
Mission in Pei-tang seemed to be doomed. No
one believed that they could stand the siege of
the frantic mob, for, except a garden wall a few
feet high, there were no means of defence. It
was due to the most resolute courage and valour
that the little flock did not surrender. Old and
young, priests and soldiers, fought side by side<span class="pagenum">[150]</span><a name="index150"></a>
in the breaches from morning to night.</p>

<p>During the weary weeks of the siege many fell
under arms, and many more among the orphans
and sisters of charity died of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The recent graves forming the small cemetery
in the inner garden were dug to receive the bodies
of these new martyrs.</p>

<p>But, after all, Christian faith triumphed over
pagan hatred, and finally the hour of deliverance
struck. And today Pei-tang and its
cathedral stand finer and stronger than before,
to the benefit of humanity and the glory of God.</p>


<p class="center">III<br />
THE NEW LEGATION QUARTERS</p>

<p>It is now a month since I arrived in Pekin.
The autumn has passed quickly&mdash;and October is
the finest time during the whole year in the
yellow capital, for the weather is mild and
clear. In the morning it is cool, and frosts are
not rare at night. But later in the day the
skies are cloudless, and the sun is often as hot as
in summer. As regards climate&mdash;which, by the
way, is an important factor in the life and progress
of a nation&mdash;Pekin is a bundle of contrasts.
The summer is hot, the winter extremely cold,
the spring wet, and the autumn very dry. Since
my arrival there has been no rain, but occasionally
it has become cloudy, and as dark as if the
sun were eclipsed. The wind, when blowing<span class="pagenum">[151]</span><a name="index151"></a>
from the north, sweeps sand from the desert
of Gobi before it, and shrouds the whole town
in a veil as it were. This sand spreads over the
whole atmosphere like a dense fog, through
which one can hardly see a yard's distance. It
penetrates windows, doors, even cracks, and
buries the whole district like a stream of lava.
After a sand-storm the sky clears, and becomes
bluer than the blue dome of the Mediterranean,
smooth and translucent as though cut out of a
gigantic sapphire. This contrast between dull
and bright weather seems to create two distinct
towns; in the one all is gloomy, in the other all
is bright. That is the reason why those who have
described Pekin have either found everything
sombre, or have looked upon it through rosy
spectacles. The truth lies between the two
extremes. I go so far as to say that each is
correct&mdash;but only relatively.</p>

<p>The traveller who would describe Pekin ought
to make daily notes of what he has seen and
heard when he sees and hears it, and use light
and shade as an artist on his canvas. He who
adopts this method will be more successful than
those who merely restrict themselves either to
recording salient points, or matters of historical
importance, or to advocating some political idea.</p>

<p>The longer I live within the walls of Pekin
the more am I convinced that, in spite of her
decadent condition, she is yet full of vitality<span class="pagenum">[152]</span><a name="index152"></a>
and, like Constantinople, embodies a national
ideal.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I stroll over to the international
area and pay a visit to all the legations.
My amiable guide, who was here during the
siege, when so many of the defenders perished,
can supply information as to many dark episodes
of the Boxer rebellion, and shows me where the
most serious attacks were made, how they bombarded
the legations from the city wall over
there, how they used to throw blazing torches
on to the roofs of these houses, and how they
tried to blow up that quarter.</p>

<p>Looking at the place now, it seems incredible
that the garrison&mdash;a mere handful&mdash;should have
been able to withstand the frenzied crowd; but
one must not forget that it was a mob, not a
disciplined army.</p>

<p>As to the French and English legations, the
former was reduced nearly to ruins, while the
latter suffered comparatively little damage, but
lost more lives.</p>

<p>The so-called European quarter is a large area
of about a mile and a half square, lying between
the Imperial city and the Tartar wall, and
crossed by the Rue des Legations.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_152.jpg" alt="The Legation Quarter" />
<p class="caption">THE LEGATION QUARTER<br />"Long rows of caravans coming from the western frontier and Tibet"<br />
[To face page 152]</p></div>

<p>I start on my round at the Legation Yamen.
In front of the royal palace on the right are the
new American barracks, before the gates of
which a number of soldiers of every nationality<span class="pagenum">[153]</span><a name="index153"></a>
are lounging. Opposite is the International
Hospital, a two-storeyed building painted light
blue; an uglier erection I have never seen, but
I am pleased to find the interior arrangements
excellent.</p>

<p>The Dutch and American legations came next,
adjoining each other, as do also the Russian and
English, but of these only the garden walls are
visible. Architecturally the American legation is
decidedly unattractive, and therefore it does not
matter much that it is hidden from view, but
the Russian and English legations are typical
Chinese dwellings. The architecture of the
latter is interesting, for the house itself belonged
to one of the Imperial princes, and was built in
a style worthy of his rank. On the opposite
bank of the canal the Italian and Japanese concessions
form a square. A new wall has been
built quite recently, and is fortified at the corner
by a turret. The German legation is on the
other side of the Rue des Legations. The barracks
have just been completed, and if they were
built for vindictive reasons, Germany has more
than attained her end, so hideous are they.
Built in Gothic style, they are the most conspicuous
of all, and utterly destroy the harmony of
the Oriental forms around them. The Austro-Hungarian
legation is still in course of erection,
in the style of a villa with porticoes; its chief
merit lies in its simplicity, but it would certainly<span class="pagenum">[154]</span><a name="index154"></a>
have harmonized better with its surroundings
had the architect adhered to the style of the old
yamens. Though the walls and slender pillars
may appeal to the æsthete, it reminds one of a
castle of cards, which will easily collapse in
future troubles.</p>

<p>The series of legations is closed by the Belgian.
The Russo-Chinese and Shanghai Banks
are also in the Rue des Legations, the former
supported by Russian, the latter by English
capital. Their operations spread far and wide.</p>

<p>Such are the main features of the so-called
international territory, that famous and historic
spot, the theatre of the recent Chinese troubles.
Every inch of it was most gallantly defended by
its feeble garrison, day and night, for many
months. These heroes were decimated by the
bullet, sickness, or famine.</p>

<p>The great distance between Europe and China
was probably the reason why the outer world
knew so little of the serious nature of the siege,
and the isolation of the legations made matters
worse.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit it was barely two years
since it all happened, but, during that short
time, a new city had arisen on the ruins of the
European concession. To get a better view
I ascend a bastion, and wherever I look busy
workmen meet my eyes. The Powers seem to
be vying with each other; one patronizes<span class="pagenum">[155]</span><a name="index155"></a>
gables, another prefers towers, or adorns its
walls with bastions; but all is with the view of
overshadowing their neighbours. My eye was
at first offended by the artistic shortcomings of
these buildings, but now it is their practical
defects that are conspicuous. It looks as if the
oft-quoted and melancholy chaos which followed
the victory of the Powers has found visible
expression in this new quarter. There seems
to be neither uniformity of plan nor advantage
of position.</p>

<p>But this is not the only weak point of the
Treaty of Chefoo. Its provisions fixed the war
indemnity, established commercial treaties of
dubious worth, and made a few concessions
valuable only for the moment, and this at a time
when the Powers were absolute masters and in
a position to dictate reforms, not only of local
and temporary importance, but of universal,
historical, and moral value.</p>

<p>The Boxer movement of 1900 came as a great
surprise, at any rate to the majority of the
Powers, and during the outbreak the sole aim
of some of the legations seemed to be to secure
their own advantage and defeat the aspirations
of the rest. This might partly explain how the
most guilty persons escaped punishment, and the
old state of affairs in China soon returned.</p>

<p>The foreign ministers came back and occupied
their new quarters, protected by thicker walls,<span class="pagenum">[156]</span><a name="index156"></a>
which the Boxers would have more difficulty in
pulling down. I do not know whether I ought to
take all I was told about these fortifications
seriously, but the garden walls seemed to have
been built in the belief that they were indestructible.
A few hundred soldiers are kept here by the
respective Powers to protect their subjects in case
of war. They might suffice in the event of a street
riot, but if this nation of four hundred millions
should some day determine to act in unison,
these walls and the ornamental sentries would,
I am afraid, make a very poor defence. In fact,
it is hardly to be believed that, if China were
once more to attack the European legations,
she would employ a mob for the purpose. It is
more likely that she will wait until her army is
reorganized and armed with modern rifles and
Krupp guns.</p>

<p>The new quarter exhibits the same defects as
the old. The walls, indeed, are a little higher
and the barracks have additional wings, but
they remain isolated as before.</p>

<p>It is always a difficult task to throw up defensive
works within a city&mdash;even the value of the
most efficient is questionable; but, if these
precautionary measures were absolutely needful,
it would certainly have been better to enclose
the entire European quarter with a stronger
common wall, as is the case with the Imperial
city. This would have made it possible for the<span class="pagenum">[157]</span><a name="index157"></a>
garrisons of the legations to defend any point
attacked conjointly. And it would have had the
further advantage that a really pretty, shady
town would have been built in the Anglo-Indian
style, amongst earthworks planted with trees,
instead of a number of insanitary separate walled
prisons.</p>

<p>Or would it not have been better to build the
European town outside the city gate, between
the canal and the railway, where the movement
of Pekin is least felt? Neither money nor concessions
were wanting, and, both for hygienic
and strategical reasons, it would have been far
better. The air is purer there, and, in the event
of danger, the chances of escape or of obtaining
assistance from without are far greater.</p>

<p>The present European quarter in Pekin reminds
one of a town which has been rebuilt,
after violent earthquakes, on the same spot and
in the same way, on that most unsubstantial
foundation&mdash;chance.</p>


<p class="center">IV<br />
THE TARTAR CITY</p>

<p>The outward appearance of the city, with the
exception of the European quarter, is the same
as of yore. The ground plan of Pekin is very
regular, and is formed of two squares, one
the Tartar, the other the Chinese town, each
surrounded by a separate wall, with a total<span class="pagenum">[158]</span><a name="index158"></a>
number of thirteen gates, with gigantic double-roofed
towers.</p>

<p>The centre is occupied by the Imperial city,
within which is the Purple or Forbidden City,
and inside this we come at last to the Emperor's
palaces, private mansions, villas, tea-houses,
and temples. The Imperial Palace is itself
intersected by gardens, lakes, and streams, and
looks more like a city than a palace, nay, like
a miniature picture of this whole-walled country.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_158.jpg" alt="Entrance to the Forbidden City" />
<p class="caption">ENTRANCE TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY<br />"The centre of this marvellous maze is the Emperor's sanctuary"<br />
[To face page 158]</p></div>

<p>From the large gate a broad street leads
through the Imperial and Tartar towns to the
great Southern Gate, one of the strangest thoroughfares
in the world. The innermost wall
is set in a square of broad moats. Four arched
marble bridges lead to the four gates. The
jagged wall, the pagoda-like towers of the
bastions, the arches of the bridges, all are decorated
with finely carved dragons, as rigidly prescribed
by law. Walls, moats, towers, and
palaces, are repeated in all parts of the gigantic
palace; the walls of all buildings being painted
red. The shape of the yellow-tiled roofs is that
of booths. Everything is planned in accordance
with traditions thousands of years old. The
threshold must not be larger than that which
Confucius crossed, nor must the door be wider
than the length of the great teacher's arms.</p>

<p>Every detail of the dwelling, to the minutest
ornament, has some symbolic or mythical significance;<span class="pagenum">[159]</span><a name="index159"></a>
for instance, at the entrance one
never fails to find the wall which tradition
demands to protect the peaceful inhabitants
from evil spirits, while the ceiling of the house
must not be higher than any of the goblins
would care to ascend.</p>

<p>In the same way the trimming or embroidery
of the dress of an official or courtier has its particular
meaning. This likewise applies to private
individuals, and the innermost chambers of
their homes, simply because it is required by
law.</p>

<p>It is this rigid system that makes China appear
so uniform, at any rate outwardly. This same
system, too, gives her her great interest from a
psychological point of view.</p>

<p>There is hardly any nation or people, throughout
the whole history of civilization, whose life
has been so profoundly and lastingly influenced
by doctrine as the population of the Yellow
Empire has been by the teachings of Confucius.
From the celestial altar (representing the centre of
the universe), where only the Son of Heaven may
worship his Father, down to each separate temple,
yamen, and stone of sacrifice, everything expresses
one and the same ethical idea. It is this gigantic
moral system, with its organic life penetrating
to the minutest detail, that keeps China strong,
even in her present decadence, and makes Pekin,
even amidst its ruins, one of the greatest cities<span class="pagenum">[160]</span><a name="index160"></a>
on earth. It is the plan, or let us say conception,
which makes us wonder. The metaphysical
qualities of this people fascinate us; their
ancient traditions are still their strongholds,
and their old systems, however degenerate, the
source of moral strength. But I hope to deal
more fully elsewhere with the psychological
side of China. At present I only want to give
a hasty sketch of its capital.</p>

<p>One can scarcely imagine a more systematically
laid out city than Pekin. The throne is
in the centre; thence radiates every street,
thither leads every road. It is the focus of the
city, the heart of the empire, but&mdash;forbidden
ground. The man who sets foot therein forfeits
his life, so sacred and inviolable is it. Within
the second wall the Imperial Family and the
Court reside, precious stones set in gold, as the
bards say.</p>

<p>Next comes the so-called Imperial city. The
extensive Lotus Lake, the long marble bridge,
the Maisan hill, the summer residence of the
Dowager Empress, are all contained in that
vast area&mdash;a number of little towns whose
wonders would take whole chapters to describe.
Each of them has its own mysterious
history.</p>

<p>There was a time when, among the clusters
of the lotus, more blood flowed than water.
Upon one of the islets stands a summer-house,<span class="pagenum">[161]</span><a name="index161"></a>
a very homely building, looking as though its
only purpose must be to shelter happiness; but
fate made a most gloomy prison of it. There
the young Emperor was confined, in anguish,
like a criminal, and never knowing whether the
morrow would find him alive or lying at the
bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>Poor young Emperor! Though he has regained
his liberty&mdash;if leaving the island for the
palace walls can be called freedom&mdash;his mind is
wrapped in darkness. His youthful dream of
making his people happy has vanished for ever.
His lofty ideals have crumbled to dust, and of
his early counsellors, some are in exile, others in
the eternal silence.</p>

<p>The new town residence of the Empress
is along the south-eastern wall, and there are
other houses enclosed in gardens, all exhibiting
the same architectural uniformity&mdash;red walls
and yellow roofs. The only decoration is the
marble staircase with carved dragons. In the
adjacent gardens are the quarters of the household
staff, and close by the old Foreign Mission
and the cathedral. The Mission exchanged
those quarters for a fine site farther off, where
it is now established.</p>

<p>The <i>Maisan</i> (meaning "mount of coal") is an
artificial hill in front of the principal Northern
Gate. Its five peaks are adorned with fine
summer residences of unequalled beauty, and<span class="pagenum">[162]</span><a name="index162"></a>
roofed with enamelled tiles, displaying a number
of the porcelain towers so familiar to us from our
school-books.</p>

<p>Many versions have come down to posterity
as to the origin of the <i>Maisan</i>, but I am inclined
to think that originally it was erected for the same
purpose as the walls round the gates&mdash;that of protection
against evil spirits. My assumption is
rather confirmed by the fact that in the grove extending
along the side of the hill stands the great
death-chamber, a hall supported on colossal
pillars, wherein is deposited the coffin of a deceased
Emperor. The funeral procession passes through
the large Northern Gate in front of the graves of
the Emperors. In China, where everything has a
meaning, it would be fallacious to assume that
the <i>Maisan</i> did not symbolize something, and
the uncertainty and mystery only enhance the
beauty of the evergreen groves of the place.
It is like the Roman Testaccian Hill in this respect,
the only interesting feature of whose
barrenness lies in its mysterious origin.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_162.jpg" alt="Triumphal Arch" />
<p class="caption">TRIUMPHAL ARCH<br />"The <i>Maisan</i> is an artificial wall in front of the principal<br />Northern Gate"<br />
[To face page 162]</p></div>

<p>The fourth wall is that of the Tartar city,
which is almost square, and has altogether ten
gates&mdash;three to the north, three to the south,
two to the east, and two to the west. The wall
is about seventeen miles long and fifty feet high,
and so wide that a dozen soldiers abreast can ride
on it comfortably. At its four corners are four

three-storeyed bastions with double-gabled,<span class="pagenum">[163]</span><a name="index163"></a>
green-tiled roofs. Over the gates are towers
with similar roofs, and everywhere the same
Imperial emblems, the same dragons and ornamentation.
Everything bears the stamp of
uniformity, embodying one canon of taste and
one idea.</p>

<p>One can hardly imagine a grander and more
sombre structure than the symmetrical, harmonious
walls of Pekin, and the more we see of
them the more we are charmed.</p>

<p>The wall of the Chinese town was added to
that of the Tartar city to form a parallelogram;
it is similar to the former, though somewhat
more modest. To the north the three gates of
the Tartar city serve as entrance, while on its
eastern and western sides are two gates respectively,
and to the south is the principal entrance
to Pekin. Then come the moats and ditches
and the ubiquitous bridges. So any one desiring
to approach the throne must pass altogether
through five cities, seven gates, and five bridges,
and in the Imperial city one must walk through
five halls and five courts ere the throne itself is
reached.</p>

<p>The conception of all this is as grand as it is
masterly. Nowhere is the idea of majesty enhanced
so infinitely, and nowhere is power
adorned to such an extent as in China. The
Winter Palace and Windsor Castle are merely
private dwellings, and even Versailles loses much<span class="pagenum">[164]</span><a name="index164"></a>
of its grandeur when compared to the Imperial
Palace in Pekin.</p>

<p>It is only a few months since the Court returned
from its protracted exile to the deserted
palaces; and what a brilliant and magnificent
spectacle that grand procession afforded on the
long route through five cities and so many gates
and bridges! although the uniforms of the soldiers
must have looked rather shabby and the
coats of the mandarins somewhat worn. The
pageant must have been one of the most striking
ever seen.</p>


<p class="center">V<br />
THE CHINESE CITY</p>

<p>The skill of the mechanics and industry of the
Chinese artisans are proverbial, and it is a never-ending
source of interest to watch them, or to
study the commercial spirit of the people. I
have lately seen a good deal of the commercial
life of Pekin, though I am more familiar with
that of Niu-chwang. The long rows of caravans,
coming from the western frontier and Tibet,
and laden with merchandise peculiar to those
regions, are characteristic of the former.</p>

<p>The centre of trade is in the Chinese city; but
how can I convey an idea of this to those who
do not know this people and this part of the
world? What a blending of colours! what noise<span class="pagenum">[165]</span><a name="index165"></a>
and dust! what an infinity of light and shade!
what a wonderful mosaic! Who could ever
grasp the total effect in all its splendour? Who
could ever understand it in all its mystery?</p>

<p>Every detail is so novel, and everything I see
comes as a surprise. During my prolonged stay
I go out every afternoon on some extended walk
of exploration, and the greatest charm of my
wanderings is that I come across famous monuments
when I least expect them. I divide the city
into different portions, and each day I visit another
quincunx. My task is the easier owing to the fact
that the town is built on a chess-board plan, like
a military encampment. Strictly speaking, it is
composed of several towns, each having its own
distinct characteristics and purpose, and each
a peculiar architecture, while each is inhabited
by a different caste. The so-called Tartar city
is the home of all the Manchus, who followed the
present dynasty from their native land. They
are mostly public officials, or enrolled in the
Imperial army.</p>

<p>The Inner, or Imperial city, is reserved for
mandarins and higher Court dignitaries, and
encloses the more restricted area with the three
consecutive cities&mdash;the Purple, Forbidden, and
Sacred. One part of the Purple City is entirely
reserved for the Empress Dowager, and the
other part contains the abodes of the Court and
their guardians. The centre of this marvellous<span class="pagenum">[166]</span><a name="index166"></a>
maze is the Emperor's sanctuary.</p>

<p>On the southern side of the Tartar city extends
the Chinese city, set apart entirely for
commercial purposes, where all the Chinese live,
whence its name. All the famous shops are
there, and there a bustling trade is carried on
from morning till night.</p>

<p>"Are the Pekin sights worth seeing?" is the
universal question of new arrivals. It would
be easier to give an answer if one were asked,
"What is <i>not</i> worth seeing, and what can be
omitted in Pekin?" Among my many excursions
there was not one devoid of some striking
discovery&mdash;a fine building, unknown spot, or
quaint scene; and even when I did not come
across any regular sight, I was always surrounded
by a world full of interest, a world by itself.</p>

<p>If I were to give my opinion, I should advise
the foreigner, before everything, to examine
this quaint world which surrounds him, and to
seek to understand its exuberant life; and it
would be a great advantage to visit the different
parts of the city at different hours of the day,
to watch the sun rise from the city walls when
the town seems to awake with the sudden burst
of light, and to pass the morning hours in the
narrow lanes, overcrowded with shops; at midday
to pay visits to the official yamens and to
local grandees, or to drive in the afternoon to
one of the temples, or make an excursion to the<span class="pagenum">[167]</span><a name="index167"></a>
neighbouring shrines and watch the sun set
from the eastern hills, or the top of the famous
pagodas, lost amidst the country.</p>

<p>From an artistic standpoint there are a great
many gems to be found, while so far as nature
is concerned, the surrounding hills are unsurpassed
in their scenery.</p>

<p>The Imperial deer-park is very fine too, and in
its quiet melancholy offers a charming haunt for
solitary rides. Another place for an outing is the
famous Princesses' Tombs, which are worth while
visiting in every respect. And there is the charming
old Portuguese cemetery, with its sad graves of
the first Christians, who played such a leading part
at the Emperor's Court in the seventeenth century.
The inscriptions on the monuments and
white marble crosses are so many records of the
first missionaries' work. And farther on is one
of Pekin's architectural marvels, the well-known
so-called Thirteen-storeyed Pagoda. Its walls are
richly carved with uncanny figures, and it is
covered with an indescribable roof, looking like
thirteen umbrellas put one on top of the other.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, the two Summer Palaces,
one of rich French rococo, but now lying in ruins,
and the other, which still serves as a summer
abode, occupying a vast area, scattered over
with many kiosks, tea-houses, and yamens,
laid out with marvellous gardens, artificial fishponds,
and marble bridges. Unluckily, entrance<span class="pagenum">[168]</span><a name="index168"></a>
to it is strictly forbidden, and a trespasser would
be punished by decapitation. Until quite recently
permission was never accorded to a
foreigner to penetrate this forbidden paradise.
Now on certain occasions the diplomatic body
is received within, and at such a function I was
an invited guest; but as I have endeavoured,
in another chapter, to give a description, however
inadequately, of this wonderland of china
pagodas, hanging gardens belonging to the
modern Semiramis, and forests planted with
miniature orchards and pines, I will not enlarge
upon them here. It would indeed be impossible
to depict in words what can only be realized by
sight. I can only hope that others may have
the same privilege.</p>

<p>I would give the same advice with regard to
the Imperial Palace in Pekin, which, after all,
is the greatest wonder of this wondrous city.</p>

<p>While rambling in Pekin, no one should omit
to explore the main thoroughfares of both cities,
to visit the side lanes, nor to stop before the great
Chinese Gate, or Ta-chin-men, and look straight
down and enjoy the marvellous panorama of
the Ch'ien-men, or Great Street. Sitting on the
marble balustrade of the Ch'ien-men San-tau
Bridge, one could spend hours in watching the
extraordinary scene. The whole population of
this gigantic city seems to assemble here at
certain hours of the day. Rich mandarins on<span class="pagenum">[169]</span><a name="index169"></a>
horses with elaborate trappings and humble
coolies, princes coming from Mongolia, carried
in splendid litters, are stopped by the half-naked
members of the celebrated Beggars' Guild.
There are shops on both sides and booths in front
of each shop, displaying more modest wares; and
besides this double row of shops, there is a third
row of goods for sale; but this department consists
merely of mats or sheets of paper spread
out in the gutter, where ragamuffins offer the
treasure-trove of the preceding night. Behind
the Ch'ien-men Street is a maze of alleys, packed
with warehouses and richly carved fronts, which
form the most marvellous bazaar ever seen. And
the effect of this fairyland built of cardboard and
tinsel is enhanced by the sun coming through
the open spaces in the awnings in shafts of light.
Indeed, I would strongly recommend every one
to take his first reconnoitring walk through
the Ch'ien-men quarter.</p>

<p>As for sights and architectural treasures,
there is such an amazing number of them that
it is necessary to employ a little discrimination
and to put aside the ambition of the average
sightseer, which is to say, "I did them all."</p>

<p>Among the temples, the Hall of the Classics,
or Pi-yung-kung, also called the Temple of Confucius,
which contains the complete text of the
nine King or Classical Books, the foundation of
ancient Chinese literature, is one of the most<span class="pagenum">[170]</span><a name="index170"></a>
remarkable. There are several interesting buildings
in its shady grounds, and the entrance arch,
covered with beautiful yellow porcelain, is a
triumph of Chinese art. Kwo-tsze-chien is
another fine pile, and its foundation dates from
the time of the Yuan dynasty, which reigned in
the thirteenth century. The main hall contains
a most interesting wooden tablet, with a characteristic
inscription as follows: "The tablet to
the soul of the most holy ancestral teacher,
Confucius."</p>

<p>The best known and most often described
temple is that of the famous Lama monastery,
which is a town in itself, composed of many
buildings and still owning many art treasures,
some very good pieces of cloisonné, and
excellent jade work. At certain hours of the
day the monks have services with wonderful
ritual, and a procession of the Great Lama, clad
in royal purple and saffron-yellow, followed by
his silk-draped staff, wearing helmets and crests
bristling with feathers. It is a spectacle of unquestionable
novelty to a European.</p>

<p>Outside the wall one must not omit a visit to
Hwang-ssu, where, in the centre court, stands
a white marble monument, erected by the Emperor
Kien-lung to the memory of the Teshoo
Lama, who was the uncle of the one in Lhassa,
the Dalai Lama, and who, during a visit to the
Imperial city, where he was the guest of the<span class="pagenum">[171]</span><a name="index171"></a>
Emperor himself, died suddenly, as the inscription
says, of malignant smallpox. Not less
famous is the Ta-chung-ssu, or Temple of the
Great Bell. It was built in the sixteenth century,
and contains the largest bell in the empire,
which a century and a half before was cast by
order of Yung-Lo.</p>

<p>But among all the temples, as its name indicates,
the finest is the so-called Temple of
Heaven, where only the Emperor has the right
to offer sacrifice. It stands in a grove, occupying
over a square mile, in the south-eastern
quarter of the Chinese city, and although it consists
of but a few buildings only, each is one of
the marvels of the East.</p>

<p>The main hall is a rotunda, a kind of pagoda
built on top of a platform, which, with its
balustrade and the flight of steps skirting it
all round, are of finely carved marble. The
colonnade, supporting the umbrella-like roof,
is of purple lacquered timber, the tiles being
of blue porcelain; and I think it is the only
building which is permitted to be covered
with the colour of the sky. From this unique
shrine, across the grass and through the grove,
leads a marble pathway to the Imperial altar.</p>

<p>This altar, if so it can be called, is really
another platform like the previous one from
which we came, but it is even more imposing,
higher, and surrounded by more elaborate stairs<span class="pagenum">[172]</span><a name="index172"></a>
and finer balustrades. It has no shrine and no
pagoda on the top of it; its colonnade is formed
by the cedars and cypresses of the grove which
surround it, and the dome of this spotless white
marble pedestal is the cloudless blue sky.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_172.jpg" alt="The Temple of Heaven" />
<p class="caption">THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN<br />"The main hall is a rotunda"<br />
[To face page 172]</p></div>

<p>It would be vain to try to make the beauty of
this spot comprehensible. Besides, my aim is
not to trespass on the domain of a guide-book,
which very likely would give a whole chapter
to this place, and even so, I am afraid, would
never succeed in conveying the poetic impression
of the unique shrine.</p>

<p>I must, however, mention a few other places
of interest. The Temple of the Earth, for instance,
which is also very extensive, has some
very fine buildings, a delightful old sundial, and
an emblematic well. In an open space there is
a field of rice, the symbol of fertility, where the
Emperor ploughs the first furrow of the year.</p>

<p>Of course, the two huge towers which look
down upon us at a distance through all our
wanderings should not be omitted either. One
is the Tower of the Gong or Bell, and the other
that of the Drum. They are, in fact, two belfries,
for announcing all good or evil news to the
citizens.</p>

<p>I would also recommend everybody to go where
the two Gothic spires lift their graceful forms
towards heaven, and to pass an afternoon at the


Mission of Pei-tang, where they will meet with an<span class="pagenum">[173]</span><a name="index173"></a>
excellent reception and be offered sincere hospitality.
They may still see traces of the Boxer
vandalism, ruins and shells piled up in pyramids,
a small cemetery where all the martyrs are
buried&mdash;soldiers and priests, starving children
and helpless women&mdash;and a small commemorative
chapel. It will unquestionably please them
to see that most of the ruins have been restored,
and that the extensive orphanage houses several
hundred children. Pei-tang is a centre, not
only of faith but of work, and the children go
through hard training schools before they are
able to earn their daily bread. The boys as a
rule become artisans or tradesmen, and those
who show greater aptitude become silversmiths,
or cloisonné makers. Those who like study can
enter the adjoining grammar school or the
seminary. Needlework is the main occupation
of the little girls, who make beautiful lace and
fine embroideries, and their products find an
easy market in the European or Legation quarter.</p>

<p>Pei-tang is certainly worth visiting, and most
edifying, and not only co-religionists will find
satisfaction in all they see, but any one interested
in history, art, education, charitable work,
and civilization in general, will gather useful
information and find valuable documents.</p>

<p>As for the evenings in Pekin, even the best
guide-book will fail to give advice. At sunset
everything is closed and everybody retires; the<span class="pagenum">[174]</span><a name="index174"></a>
city gates are barred, and traffic is stopped.
Even the famous theatres are deserted, and the
plays, which begin early in the morning, must
finish at dusk. During the night Pekin is
wrapped in silence and darkness. It is only in
the European quarter that lights are to be perceived,
and loud talk, hoarse laughter, or a
hackneyed chorus, issues from a newly opened
bar&mdash;sad recreation ground for the Allied Troops,
giving the Chinese but a sorry example of the
European idea of amusement.</p>

<p>Furnished with letters of introduction, which
are more necessary in the East than passports,
the traveller will have an opportunity of passing
some charming evenings at the different legations,
and in the houses of the resident diplomatists,
officers, priests, and so forth, and they
will be able to see how their compatriots live in
exile and discuss the last events that have occurred
in the West, and, by the blue smoke of
a cigar, forecast the possibilities of the East.</p>

<p class="center "><b>THE DOWAGER EMPRESS AND THE
EMPEROR OF CHINA AT THE
SUMMER PALACE</b></p>


<p>The glorious rays of the sun burst through
it the eastern hills. From night to day is
but a moment. There is no lingering dawn.
The country is ablaze with colour, and yet the
autumn is well advanced towards the so-called
St. Martin's summer. In spite of the early
hour, the streets of Pekin show unusual bustle.
These endless thoroughfares, which on ordinary
mornings are so gloomy and deserted, have
awaked to life. At the doors of those quaint
and attractive shops, full of the strange odds
and ends that are of perennial interest to the
wanderer in the East, and at the street corners,
groups of people are talking vivaciously.
Curious eyes are peeping from little windows,
and everybody is evidently in expectation of
some unusual sight. But what gives the most
unfamiliar aspect to the scene is that there are
street-sweepers here and there, more or less
busy at their work, and a few policemen, in the
most fanciful uniforms. It is the day of the
Imperial reception of the diplomatic corps. It<span class="pagenum">[176]</span><a name="index176"></a>
is an innovation in the functions at the Court
of the Dragon that the representatives of the
Western nations should be annually received in
state, a favour which has been granted since the
Allies entered Pekin, one of the very few concessions,
I am afraid, that have been granted.</p>

<p>The Court passes the autumn in the beautiful
residence some sixteen miles from the city. We
are compelled to travel all this way, and by any
means we may find convenient, as there is no
railway. Some are riding, some are carried in
old-fashioned canopied palanquins. I see the
conservative representative of Portugal carried
by a magnificent team of stalwart Cantonese,
with endless pigtails and rich harness&mdash;I ought
to say livery. Germany, on the contrary, rattles
over the most impracticable, neglected highway
in a Tyrolean carriage, an object of great wonder
and interest to the natives, as it is the first and
only four-wheeler in the city.</p>

<p>It is a long journey, but not devoid of interest.
We pass through a series of villages and hamlets,
each of them teeming with busy life. I must
say the energy and industry of the Chinese fill
me with admiration. All along the road we
meet people bearing signs of trade or commerce.
Some are carrying huge baskets of fruit, of
flowers, or grain. Others are laden with many
kinds of goods. Many push wheelbarrows burdened
with more than a European cart could<span class="pagenum">[177]</span><a name="index177"></a>
bear. Caravans of heavy Mongolian camels
roped together travel to and fro in one never-ending,
sinuous line. But the greater part of the
traffic is absorbed by the Imperial household.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the Summer Palace
is a town in itself, a city inhabited by thousands
of mandarins, Court functionaries, attendants,
servants, and labourers. The number, I believe,
is estimated at ten thousand, and the daily
expenses at something incalculable. The country
all round is marvellously cultivated. It is
interesting to watch the people at work in the
fields, and see by what primitive methods they
obtain such surprising results.</p>

<p>At last we arrive at the palace, and are met by
such a crowd that it is with difficulty that any
progress can be made at all. Most of the legations
have sent out guards with tents, where
the representatives can put on their full dress.
We gather afterwards before the palace gates
in a typical yamen, a choice specimen of Chinese
domestic architecture, simple in conception, but
elaborate in detail.</p>

<p>Prince Ching, Minister for Foreign Affairs,
arrives; unquestionably a striking figure and
an interesting personality. Slim, even fragile,
his yellow skin covers the bones of his face like
an old parchment, pale and wrinkled, and the
brightness of his small, beady eyes makes a
striking contrast. The introductions at once<span class="pagenum">[178]</span><a name="index178"></a>
begin; but as Prince Ching does not speak either
French or English, his secretary acts as interpreter.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, this gentleman is a
member of one of the numerous Li family; but
what I specially recollect is his exquisite manner,
exceptional refinement, and wide knowledge.
He speaks perfect French, has travelled all over
Europe, has stopped in our capitals for years,
and taken a special interest in our scientific institutions.
I confess to very much surprise
when he began to testify his personal appreciation
of my own national university of Buda
Pesth. Perhaps it is the old-fashioned Chinese
dress, mandarin hat, or pigtail, that causes Western
people to feel astonished at finding among
natives of the Yellow Empire sometimes a more
thorough knowledge of the West and a deeper
insight into our minds than we can realize.</p>

<p>The empty compliments have been exchanged&mdash;and
empty indeed they are. At last an escort
of palace guards and mandarins arrives, to lead
us towards the inner palace gate.</p>

<p>I wish I could have fixed the picture then
unrolled before my eyes; or have possessed a
lantern of real magic, that could picture now all
I saw, outline and colour and haze, all that
was bright and all that was shadow!</p>

<p>It was a scene never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>A crowd dressed in all the hues of the rainbow,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span><a name="index179"></a>
carrying silken flags, embroidered banners,
painted inscriptions, gauze-covered lanterns,
and glittering trophies: all the emblems of
power, all the symbols of the Celestial Empire.
The wondrous crowd stretches into a scattered
procession and winds across the narrow lane
like a giant serpent, with shimmering scales, in
a fairy tale.</p>

<p>A more fitting pageant could not approach
the Dragon's Court. The huge scarlet gate,
studded with golden nails, swings open on its
groaning hinges. Soldiers, like the fantastic
creations of an uncanny dream, present their
strange medley of arms&mdash;long spears, crescent-shaped
scythes, threatening spikes, and grim
battle-axes, are silhouetted against the peaceful
sky.</p>

<p>We enter the huge courtyard, and there is
another surprise. A large square, paved with
white marble, enclosed on the four sides by four
marble terraces supporting each an open hall,
covered with yellow tiles, and the whole domed
by the sapphire firmament of the Eastern sky.
The open space is filled with mandarins, all
dressed in dark blue silk embroidered with gold;
at first sight all very much alike, and yet in the
embroidery very different, each minute detail
expressing some distinction. Through the central
hall we get to another great courtyard, apparently
a copy of the first, larger, finer, and<span class="pagenum">[180]</span><a name="index180"></a>
more magnificent, but in style always the same;
four open halls, white marble terraces, white
marble pavements, golden roofs, and sapphire
dome. All the inmates are clad in sapphire and
gold, the only colours I could perceive. The
whole picture is painted in the gradations of
these hues. It was a perfect harmony of colour,
so artistic and refined that it compelled admiration.</p>

<p>I have been at many great receptions, but I
can remember none more impressive than the
reception at the Summer Palace. That suppliants
at the throne must arrive through many
gates and courts and halls enhances the effect.
As you approach, each gate is more magnificent,
each courtyard larger, each hall loftier, all combining
to add grandeur to the ceremony.</p>

<p>In each court there are suave courtiers and
silky mandarins. As we advance the rank is
higher, until in the inner court there are assembled
the highest Viceroys and Princes of
the Imperial blood.</p>

<p>But I have no leisure to observe the glory of
the place&mdash;gold, jewels, and sunshine are too
much together. I can only see a dark blue carpet
that leads us to the steps of the central hall&mdash;or
pagoda, as I would prefer to call it&mdash;one of
those fancy structures we read about in nursery
tales.</p>

<p>The hall seems indeed strange to us; marvellous<span class="pagenum">[181]</span><a name="index181"></a>
to Western eyes. It takes me some time
to distinguish between colour and shape, what
is reality and what is fiction. At first I perceive
flowers gathered into wreaths and hung in
rich festoons. They are chrysanthemums of
many shapes and shades, some exceedingly
small, some exceptionally large, some resembling
the rose, some like huge spiders; from pale
sulphur to dark bronze, there is every hue of
gold. They are placed in bowls and vases,
marvels of age, of incomparable beauty and
priceless value, which, as I hear from my
friend Li, were rebought at extortionate
figures from the Europeans who looted them.</p>

<p>And in this perfect garden of flowers there are
mounds of magnificent fruit piled up in brightly
enamelled cloisonné dishes, fresh peaches, luscious
pears, bright oranges; but again, all of
them in the tints of gold. Each fruit and flower,
of which there are so many standing isolated,
has its symbolic meaning in China&mdash;the peach,
longevity; the plum, youth; the cherry, affection;
and the chrysanthemum, everlasting
beauty.</p>

<p>But I do not want to read the language of
fruits and flowers. What interests me is the
artistic beauty of the decorations and the perfect
stage management of the surroundings.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the artist or the
organizer it is perfect. It is an exquisite harmony,<span class="pagenum">[182]</span><a name="index182"></a>
limited to the tones of gold, the sapphire,
and the emerald, with the rich hues of a peacock's
feather carried to its climax in decorations,
paintings, embroidery, dresses, flowers,
and fruit.</p>

<p>Each object in the hall has its purpose in the
magnificent scheme. It may be a simple chrysanthemum
or a flag on the canopy over the
throne itself, but they all emphasize the same
grand central idea.</p>

<p>Whatever our opinions of Chinese art may be,
we cannot fail to admire its vigour and its refinement.
During my repeated visits to that land, it
gave me continuous interest and constant surprises.
It is always grand, always strong, and
always refined.</p>

<p>These same features strike me here today in
the Summer Palace. The greatness of the architectural
conception, the marvellous plan of the
surroundings, the amplitude of the accessories,
all contribute to make the Summer Palace of
Pekin more royal and imperial than any other
palace in the world. And again, as to refinement,
I cannot imagine anything more charming
than the decorations and embellishments, which
are modulated like a symphony.</p>

<p>What is the Dowager Empress like? What
do you think of the young Emperor? are questions
everybody will ask. In the first place,
the Empress is of average height, strongly built,<span class="pagenum">[183]</span><a name="index183"></a>
and completely self-possessed. As for her dress,
I am afraid I cannot describe ladies' attire as I
can objects of art. She was, I remember, clad
in some dark blue colour, embroidered with
golden thread. What struck me most was the
Manchu head-dress, which causes the hair to project
from the head like the long wings of a bat,
each decorated with a bunch of chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>The Empress is a Manchu, and clings to her
national garments and fashions, which, if they
have no other advantage, at least permit the
children's feet to be at liberty, contrary to the
Chinese custom.</p>

<p>She was seated on a high throne, elaborately
carved, heavily gilded, and covered by a magnificent
canopy. Before her was a table, on
which she rested her long-nailed fingers. On
her left, one step below, the Emperor was seated,
making in his meek appearance a striking contrast
to his imperious aunt.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the Dowager Empress
of China has a commanding appearance.
Nearly seventy years of age, she looks
younger, and her strong features have kept all
their mobility. The square forehead, strong
nose, and firm mouth, are the most prominent
features; but I think her character is best seen
in the drooping twitch of the mouth, and her
searching gaze. Nothing seems to escape her.<span class="pagenum">[184]</span><a name="index184"></a>
During the whole reception her keen glance followed
every movement, and examined separately
every individual.</p>

<br />"With the Empress Dowager of China"<br />
[To face page 184]</p></div>

<p>We stood in a long row before the steps of the
throne, and the <i>doyen</i> of the diplomatic body
stepped forward to deliver his official greeting.
It was a cordial speech; taking recent events
into consideration, almost too cordial, and I am
afraid, as translated by Prince Ching, it assumed
an even more complimentary tone.</p>

<p>Even so it did not rise to this proud woman's
expectations. She heard it unmoved, without
any visible sign of emotion, I venture to say
without interest.</p>

<p>Her mouth retained its sceptical curve, her
glance was cold and haughty; and when old
Prince Ching had kow-towed for the last time
to the ground the Empress gave the order by a
commanding sign that the answer should be
read, but without uttering a syllable.</p>

<p>The answer was read, and listened to in perfect
silence. The fall of a leaf could have been
heard. It was not long, and merely said, "Her
Majesty the Empress was glad the representatives
of the Powers had had a favourable day for
their visit."</p>

<p>Was it meant to be a compliment or was it
sarcasm? It would be difficult to judge. It was
ambiguous, but it gave a certain insight into
the speaker's character. It might have served<span class="pagenum">[185]</span><a name="index185"></a>
to explain a little bit more of this extraordinary
mind which has manifested itself in such manifold
ways, and led to so many paradoxical
actions. Of the dark stories that are whispered
of the palace, I would not like to speak.
Whether they are true or false must always
remain in doubt.</p>

<p>If the Empress is not talkative when receiving
a diplomatic body, if she is silent on a state
occasion, it only shows her great caution. It
was by her personal ability and hard work she
rose step by step to the highest position of the
empire. To attain it undoubtedly hard work
and strength were required, and to keep it all
her life must have called for even greater efforts.
And this is so much more the case on account of
the insignificance of the part played by women
in Chinese life. What ways and means she employed
must be left for history to narrate.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, she seemed to be a
keen observer. All she saw, the whole reception,
must have been so new to her, if we consider
that to be seen by ordinary human eyes
is to the Celestial Imperial Family like a crime.
Each time the Court moves from the Summer
to the Winter Palace, along the whole length
of the road each door and shutter is heavily
closed, and the punishment of decapitation
hangs over anybody discovered gazing at her.</p>

<p>It must seem even harder to have to receive<span class="pagenum">[186]</span><a name="index186"></a>
a body of men in the privacy of her home, for
such a proceeding is utterly repugnant to all
Eastern conceptions.</p>

<p>But it might interest people to know that,
on one occasion, when she invited only the ladies
of the foreign legations, her reception of them
was most cordial. She took tea with them, and
showed unlimited interest in all their domestic
affairs. She wanted to know the number of
their children, the exact amount of their incomes;
but what seemed to interest her most
of all was their age. She admired some of their
jewels, and went so far as to ask as a souvenir
a very costly fan, and returned, as the greatest
sign of her regard, one of her own. Its value
was small, as it merely consisted of a few square
inches of rice-paper, on which were painted a
few chrysanthemums. But, as the Empress
explained with a witty smile, the painting was
the work of her own hands, and she hoped that
would be an ample reward.</p>

<p>There is no question, the Dowager Empress
is a clever woman and a skilful politician. The
best proof of her diplomatic ability is that she
is seated before us on her golden throne. The
day on which the rescuing force was led into the
besieged city to relieve the famishing legations
and help the tortured Christians, the Empress
and all her Court were fleeing through a devastated
country in a lumbering wooden car. The<span class="pagenum">[187]</span><a name="index187"></a>
mighty Empress took refuge in humble houses,
hid herself in stables, and crawled for concealment
into caves. Who would have believed
that those deserted beings, that scattered Court,
would return to the palace under the protection
of the same allied force that arrived to avenge
outraged Justice and set her once more on her
throne?</p>

<p>The life of the young Emperor is familiar to
all. His struggle for freedom and progress
failed utterly, and he now seems, morally and
physically, a wreck. I was told that when his
ideas had been discovered he was separated from
his entourage, shut up in a pavilion, and kept as
a prisoner. He sat in his armchair, immovable,
almost as if he were asleep. It was a sad spectacle,
and one to arouse the deepest sympathy.</p>

<p>We remained for the whole of the day as guests
of Their Majesties, wandering in the wonderland
of their favourite grounds, going from palace to
pagoda, from temple to hall, each a separate
gem of Chinese art, and each bearing evidence
of wanton mutilation by the allied troops.
I felt grieved that such monuments of history
and pieces of art, which should have been a
cherished possession of all the world, should
have been destroyed by what we call civilized
white men.</p>

<p>We strolled over marble bridges, climbed
pagodas built of china, were shown the marvellous<span class="pagenum">[188]</span><a name="index188"></a>
orchard, planted with dwarf trees, the
favourite resort of the Princess, and had tea
served on the Marble Boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_188.jpg" alt="The Summer Palace" />
<p class="caption">THE SUMMER PALACE<br />"We remained for the whole day as guests of their Majesties, wandering in the wonderland of their favourite grounds"<br />
[To face page 188]</p></div>

<p>But the great feature of the day was the state
banquet, where we were served with, I dare
say, a hundred courses of unimaginable dainties:
sharks' fins, water-sparrows, eggs of great age,
nests of sea-birds, and puppy chops. But I will
not weary my readers with such details.</p>

<p>I only want to tell of my journey back along
the dusty highway to Pekin. I was so worn out
and faint with hunger, not having been able to
appreciate the Chinese cooking, that I stopped
for rest and a dish of boiled rice at our orphanage
at Pei-tang, where the popular hooded nuns,
so well known for their heroic sacrifices on battle-fields,
in plague hospitals and leper homes,
maintain an asylum to save the lives of little
children who would otherwise sometimes be killed
by their own parents.</p>

<p>These children are brought up to be good men
and useful citizens; and I can only wish that
the Empress, instead of giving banquets of a
hundred courses at the Summer Palace, would
send some crumbs to the little starving babes.</p>

<p>And never have I appreciated a meal more
than on that evening, after so much gold and
glitter and external show, in the humble abode.</p>

<p class="center "><b>KOREA OF BYGONE DAYS AND ON THE
EVE OF THE WAR</b></p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>The history of Korea reads like a fairy tale.
The Land of the Morning Calm beyond the
seas is so quaint, so very much out of the common,
that we can hardly realize that all we hear
of it is reality and not mere fiction.</p>

<p>The country, the people, and the life are all
strange, and totally different from what we see
and meet with in other parts of the world. I
can scarcely imagine anything more impressive
than for a traveller coming straight from some
Western port to land in this country&mdash;one of
the remotest in the East. It is as though he
had set foot in a topsy-turvy world; everything
is the reverse of what he has been accustomed
to. Facts and ideas are antagonistic
to ours; things material and spiritual seem to
be governed by other rules and other natural
laws.</p>

<p>The origin of Korea is buried in myth and
mystery; its past is so varied, such an ever-changing
chiaroscuro, that we look upon it as<span class="pagenum">[190]</span><a name="index190"></a>
legendary. Its present remains true to tradition.</p>

<p>Within the limits of this chapter I would like
to deal with Korea from a more utilitarian point
of view, and not merely to describe the traditions,
quaint customs, and picturesque features of the
land. My desire is to represent Korea not only
as one of the quaintest countries on the surface
of the globe&mdash;a land of old-world type&mdash;but as a
country in the first stage of transition.</p>

<p>The difference between ancient and modern
Korea is stupendous; a few years seem to have
done the work of centuries. Korea of the past
is undoubtedly the more attractive to the
traveller, but Korea of the present does not
lack interest for one anxious to find in this corner
of the earth something more than panoramic
scenery.</p>

<p>The old order still catches the eye everywhere;
new reforms are lost in the crowd. Outwardly
everything is old, but an inward change is being
effected day by day. The ancient cut and
faint colour of the garb have been preserved,
but new ideas are being constantly interwoven
and are obliterating the old. Ancient habits
and customs are dying out hourly and irretrievably,
and have to give way to modern
utilitarianism. The days of old Korea are numbered.</p>

<p>The appearance of the whole country is<span class="pagenum">[191]</span><a name="index191"></a>
altered. Railways now intersect the quiet,
dreamy countryside; buildings of architectural
beauty, as well as humble cottages, are disappearing
to make room for modern houses and
factories. The charm of the scenery will inevitably
vanish in face of the commercial and
industrial progress. The world is moving on;
it is necessary that it should, and change must
follow the flight of time.</p>

<p>But I am glad that I am here today and not
to-morrow; glad that I know Korea as it has
been in the past. For who knows what future
awaits her?</p>

<p>I shall never be able fully to describe my first
impressions. Everything that meets my eye is
new, that which surrounds me is unintelligible,
almost mysterious. Korea and Tibet are the
most isolated countries in Asia, and have, therefore,
most completely preserved their ancient
traditions and customs. It is only a quarter
of a century since Korea first opened her gates
to foreigners. Radical changes can hardly be
expected to take place within a few years; the
remodelling of a country and its people is the
work of many generations.</p>


<p class="center ">II<span class="pagenum">[192]</span><a name="index192"></a></p>

<p>Korea, as we see on the map, lies at the furthest
eastern extremity of the Asiatic continent.
It is a peninsula in the shape of an
irregular oblong. Its frontiers on three sides
are formed by the Japanese and the Yellow
seas, and only on the north does a short strip
of land divide it from Manchuria. Its area is
eighty thousand square miles. The aspect of
the country is of great variety, extremely mountainous,
just here and there intersected by valleys.
Some of the peaks are over seven thousand
feet high; but what is more striking than their
height is their formation. They are all very
rich in mines, and the valleys are extremely
fertile, and yet Korea has been, within the
memory of man, one of the poorest countries of
the world. The mines have never been worked,
and the ground yields just enough for daily food.
Various reasons for this have been assigned.
The mines have not been worked because the
Government feared that the gathering together
of so many workmen at far-away districts
would be favourable to revolutions. A crowd
was considered a danger to the reigning family.
And I have been told that the cause of the
scanty cultivation of the fields is that it is not
worth while to have much grain stored in the
granaries, for in that case it would surely be<span class="pagenum">[193]</span><a name="index193"></a>
confiscated by the Government officials.</p>

<p>The larger rivers, like the Yalu and the Han,
would afford excellent means of communication,
but navigation is as yet practically unknown.
The natural bays could easily afford harbour
accommodation for all the fleets of the world,
but, except the few open ports, they are only
visited by some miserable native wooden
junks, and a few Japanese or Chinese fishing-boats.</p>

<p>The climate is excellent; cold, of course, in
the winter, but bright and dry; and the heat is
never as oppressive in summer as it is in the
same latitudes further inland. The natural
advantages are plentiful in every respect: the
rainfall is sufficient to secure the watering of
the fields, the snow in winter protects the ground
for several months, and there is bright sunshine
in the summer to ripen the most beautiful fruit
and grapes; but the refreshing sea-breezes prevent
it from being too hot.</p>

<p>The Korean flora resembles, to a great extent,
ours. The best-known flowers grow there. I
could say the same of vegetables, such as cabbage,
carrots, beans, peas, etc., which are all
plentiful. The one exception is potatoes, which,
though they were imported and flourished well
in the soil, were forbidden to be grown on account
of their being a foreign importation.
Turnips, peas, and beans are most commonly<span class="pagenum">[194]</span><a name="index194"></a>
grown, and I have counted more than twenty-four
varieties of beans, of different sizes, shapes,
and colours, but having no taste at all, at any
rate not when they are cooked in Korean fashion.
Tobacco has been grown lately, and so have
grapes; but the most valuable plant cultivated
is the <i>gin-sen</i>, which is a Government monopoly,
and is regarded as possessing the miraculous
power of rejuvenating those who drink the liquor
which is made of it. It is worth its weight in gold,
and a little while ago the Emperor, fearing that
the <i>gin-sen</i> crop was growing too plentiful and
that its value would consequently decline,
ordered that the surplus production should be
conveyed to an island near Chemulpo and there
burned. The closed boxes were carried in procession
to the island, watched with great interest
by the people, and were burned with great state.
Nobody knew exactly what had been the victim
of the <i>auto-da-fé</i>, but it is more than probable
that the <i>gin-sen</i>, which is assumed to have met
with such a sad fate, was devoted to some more
profitable purpose.</p>

<p>Korean timber is of world-wide fame. The
huge Korean forests are protected by law, and
each individual Korean has certain rights to
so much for building purposes, and so much for
firing.</p>

<p>Pasture land is scarcely known, and the cultivable
areas are nearly all converted into bean<span class="pagenum">[195]</span><a name="index195"></a>
and rice fields.</p>

<p>The animal world is of great variety. Among
domestic animals we find nearly all our old
friends&mdash;such as the horse, a rather rough
example but strong, oxen with magnificent
frames, goats and pigs in great numbers. There
are very few cows, as the Koreans are not great
meat-eaters, and do not know how to milk, and,
consequently, never use milk or butter. Sheep
are prohibited by law, as only the Emperor
may possess them for sacrificial purposes.
Wild animals are very plentiful. The most
dreaded are, of course, the tiger and the bear.
There are also wolves, jackals, and wild boars.
Birds are present in the greatest abundance.
Pheasants, partridges, and quails are so plentiful,
even today, that, travelling through the
country, one may buy a brace for a few pence.</p>

<p>But the real wealth of Korea consists in its
minerals. The different mountain ranges are
rich in the most valuable metals: coal, copper,
lead, silver, and gold are found in abundance.
To this subject further allusion is made later on.</p>

<p>As a race the Koreans were for many years
thought to belong to the same family as the
Chinese, but it is now considered that they
belong to another stock of the great Mongolian
race. Its origin is today sought, not so much
in the Altai, as on the slopes of the Himalayas.
There is a difference of opinion as to the route<span class="pagenum">[196]</span><a name="index196"></a>
of their migration. One theory has it that they
reached their present home by way of Siberia
and Manchuria; another that they travelled
through Southern Asia, and partly by sea, from
the cradle of mankind.</p>

<p>With regard to their physical characteristics,
the Koreans are tall, well built, and fair complexioned,
with a scanty beard. They are not
quite so tall as the Chinese of the north, but
far better proportioned, and generally quite a
head taller than their Japanese neighbours.
The women are very hard workers, and their
strength is exceptional. The children are regular
pictures of health.</p>

<p>Whoever desires to form an idea of the moral
characteristics of this race must penetrate to
their homes and watch their daily life. Their
mental and spiritual qualities can best be perceived
by daily intercourse. The attempt to
enter thus will not be easy, and seldom pleasant,
but it will never fail to be of great and permanent
interest.</p>

<p>The daily round of the Koreans is yet as primitive
and archaic as it was centuries ago, and
time seems to have left little mark on their
customs and habits.</p>


<p class="center ">III<span class="pagenum">[197]</span><a name="index197"></a></p>

<p>What are the most extraordinary things in this
Hermit Country? is the question which has been
frequently addressed to me since my return.
The answer would be much easier to give if
the question were, What are the least striking?
Everything equally astonishes a stranger&mdash;country,
people, customs, and daily life; every
detail is characteristic, and every feature&mdash;visible
and invisible&mdash;affords immense scope for observation.
For the student of psychology Korea
is a country full of interest.</p>

<p>To form some idea of the present condition of
Korea it is absolutely necessary to know something
of her past; to understand the character
of her people one must be familiar with the conditions
of life in centuries gone by.</p>

<p>Korea's historical origin, like that of most
Asiatic countries, is shrouded in darkness.
Her earliest records are legends and stories
rather than serious history. Kings and gods,
heroes and monsters, figure in a chaotic epic,
which has preserved a few of the principal events
for posterity.</p>

<p>The founder of the nation is supposed to be
Ki-Tsze, a Chinese noble, who, with his soldiers
and followers, settled on the peninsula in
1122 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> But it is difficult to say how much of
this is true, for the Koreans come, not from a
Chinese, but from a really different Tartar stock,<span class="pagenum">[198]</span><a name="index198"></a>
and consequently Ki-Tsze could only have been
a later conqueror. The reason why subsequent
chroniclers attributed the settlement of Korea
to him was probably to glorify China. A stringent
law forbidding the writing of history makes it
very difficult to collect any authentic facts
about the past of Korea. That a record of the
principal events still survives is due to a remarkable
custom.</p>

<p>Some of the Court officials kept diaries in
which they recorded everything of any importance
that took place. Each related what
seemed to him of interest, sealing up the rolls
with great secrecy. Four copies of these records
were kept in iron chests at the four
different seats of government. There the
documents were to remain until the then reigning
family became extinct, and not until the
last representative of the dynasty had departed
this life might they be published.</p>

<p>In the absence of national historical literature
foreign conquerors&mdash;Chinese and Japanese&mdash;have
issued a number of books on Korea, more
particularly in reference to their own conquests.
It would, however, be difficult to ascertain how
far these works are to be trusted.</p>

<p>Only one popular Korean history is in existence,
which, however, is more of an illustrated nursery
tale than anything else. The diaries kept by
some of the noble families are more interesting,<span class="pagenum">[199]</span><a name="index199"></a>
wherein they have recorded in unbroken series
the events of each day, year by year.</p>

<p>The first reliable information we possess dates
from the early centuries of our era. It is an
established fact that Korea was then divided
into three kingdoms&mdash;Sin-La in the south, Kao-Li
in the north, and Pet-Si in the west. These
early centuries witnessed constant civil wars,
in which sometimes one and sometimes another
of the kingdoms was victorious; but the greatest
advantages were won by Sin-La in the south.
In a good many cases these successes were due
to outside aid. Kao-Li and Pet-Si became more
than once vassals of China or Japan.</p>

<p>The three kingdoms were united in the
eleventh century. Sin-La lost its supremacy
and, with Pet-Si, was annexed to Kao-Li. The
king of this country was assisted by China in
his expedition to the north, and in return the
Mongol emperor was made the overlord of
Korea. The united kingdoms were then ruled
for three centuries by the Kao-Li dynasty, but
their power ceased with the expulsion of the
Mongol rulers from Pekin.</p>

<p>The emperors of the Ming dynasty, who became
masters of China in the fourteenth century,
also conquered Korea in 1392, re-establishing
the ancestors of the present Emperor in place
of the house of Kao-Li. Tao-Tso, the first
king, transferred his capital from Kai-Teng to<span class="pagenum">[200]</span><a name="index200"></a>
Hang-Jang, the present Seoul, recognizing the
suzerainty of China as a protection. He adopted
the Chinese calendar and sent envoys to
China to pay homage every year.</p>

<p>Subsequent events of Korean history can be
explained in the light of these facts. With the
Tsi-Tsien dynasty she became the openly acknowledged
vassal of China. The sending of
envoys to do homage, the presentation of previously
settled gifts, and also the adoption of
the Chinese calendar afford proofs of this.</p>

<p>The succeeding kings managed the affairs of
the country successfully, and Tormer-To in the
thirteenth century annexed several Japanese
islands, but this burst of glory soon died out.</p>

<p>With the fall of the Mings the history
of Korea reached its nadir. The conquering
house of Mand-Su inundated with its troops
the whole country and broke into Seoul, rendering
even stricter the obligations of the tributary.
The Chinese calendar became official from this
time, and the Celestial Son was not only sovereign,
but also managed absolutely all the private
and public affairs of the king of Korea.</p>

<p>A good number of imperial rescripts referring
to family quarrels has, to this day, been preserved,
and throws an interesting light on the dissipated
life of the Court of that remote period.</p>

<p>Korean kings stood repeatedly like criminals
before their judge, and carried out the emperor's<span class="pagenum">[201]</span><a name="index201"></a>
sentence to the letter. But they went further
than this, even to asking the Chinese emperor
for counsel in reference to petty domestic
troubles, divorce cases, etc.</p>

<p>As a rule the sentence was light. The former
Mongolian despots lost their crowns partly
through over-severity. The Mings, on the contrary,
were clever diplomatists, and by their
tact retained Korea's goodwill.</p>

<p>It is therefore not to be wondered at that
their memory is still held in esteem, and the
administration of the country, its customs and
laws, to this day represent the Ming spirit.</p>

<p>China's present Manchu dynasty has never
been popular, although it did not attempt to
perpetuate, literally, the strict conditions of
its first conquest.</p>

<p>Since the middle of the seventeenth century
Korea has never been at war with any foreign
power; but though no attacks have come from
without, intestine troubles have been even more
marked and destructive.</p>

<p>The example was set by the royal family.
In the absence of male issue, the relatives split
into two parties, who, under the names of <i>Piek-Pai</i>
and <i>Si-Pai</i>, have been rivals for years.
Bloodshed and murder followed each other;
dagger and poison were hidden under each cloak
at the Court. These two factions are still in
existence. The followers of Piek are for fighting<span class="pagenum">[202]</span><a name="index202"></a>
and progress; the Si party, on the contrary,
represent rather conservative views.</p>

<p>The example of the Court and of the chief
officials was followed by the nobility. The
principal persons of the country formed themselves
into four parties. We can trace back the
origin of the strife to the sixteenth century; its
cause was the possession of an office. Two of
the most powerful tribes claimed it, and their
personal contention soon assumed the form
of a general principle. Each party had its supporters
until the whole country fell a victim
to party strife&mdash;as was the case with the clans
of the Montagus and Capulets, or between the
houses of York and Lancaster of old.</p>

<p>After considering these premises it will be
easier to understand Korea's present political
situation.</p>

<p>We have seen that for many centuries the
country was under foreign rule, governed now
by China, now by Japan; generally by China,
who more often than not was a very mild and
lenient mistress.</p>

<p>Although she gave Korea a free hand in her
government, she retained the exclusive control
of foreign affairs; and, correctly speaking, she
did not manage them at all. But no matter who
the ruler was, Japan or China, their sole object
was always to isolate the country as much as
possible from the outer world, to surround her<span class="pagenum">[203]</span><a name="index203"></a>
with a visible or invisible wall&mdash;in the same way
as their own flowery lands. This is one of the
principal causes why Korea has been utterly
secluded for centuries.</p>

<p>But here is another cause. The people, not
being able to defend their country against invaders,
were anxious that it should remain as
unknown as possible. They went even further
than that, and hid the natural treasures from
their own citizens.</p>


<p class="center ">IV</p>

<p>The ancient government of their kingdom
was, as in most Oriental countries, extremely
complicated. The system undoubtedly shows
knowledge of considerable statesmanship, China
being the model. The mistakes and shortcomings
lay in the execution and administration.</p>

<p>The absolute master and owner of the country
was the king, who had by his side three ministers
of the first, and six of the second rank.
Each minister was assisted by one secretary of
state and one councillor. The cabinet was
called Tai-Sin, forming the Council of State.
The power of the council was only nominal, and
was invested in the three ministers of first rank,
or, rather, in the premier, whose office was for
life. Is it to be wondered at that every means<span class="pagenum">[204]</span><a name="index204"></a>
was employed to attain it?</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that the bearers of the
title were not necessarily in power. They succeeded
each other, some of them having only
honorary rank.</p>

<p>The country was divided into eight governorships.
Each governor, with powers similar to
those of a Chinese viceroy, had under him vice-governors,
county judges, public notaries, collectors
of taxes, etc. Considering that the eight
governorships were divided into 332 provinces,
the administration naturally was extensive,
requiring a complicated administration.</p>

<p>The organization of the army was likewise
well developed&mdash;on paper at any rate&mdash;the
generals being distributed according to the
provinces. Each governorship had its separate
army corps, forts, arsenals, and stores recorded
with precision. The national defence nominally
numbered not less than <i>one million two hundred
thousand men</i>, although not one-hundredth part
of those had ever seen a rifle. All this looked
very imposing in the documents placed before
the king. The same applied to the forts, arsenals,
and stores. The forts were in ruins, the arsenals
empty, and as for the stores, they did not exist.
At any rate, this was the condition of the army
when the first European troops entered the
country. There is probably not another land in
the East&mdash;and this means a good deal&mdash;where<span class="pagenum">[205]</span><a name="index205"></a>
the government was more corrupt than in
Korea.</p>

<p>The principal offices were sold at fixed prices.
To obtain one was simply a financial transaction.
Of course, directly the mandarin took up
his position he was anxious to recoup his expenses.
Under some pretext he confiscated the
property of well-to-do citizens and extorted
money from the people. This system had
another disadvantage&mdash;the tenure of office was
of short duration, lasting altogether a few years.
The holder had, therefore, to be very economical
with time. The mandarins generally remained
two or three years only at one place, in order
not to make themselves "at home." But the
principal reason for such continual changes
must have been that it was considered desirable
at headquarters to sell the office to a new purchaser.
So the succession went on, and one
official after another devoted his energy to confiscation
and robbery.</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered at that the people were
reduced to poverty? But even those who were
possessed of property lived the life of beggars,
as otherwise the mandarins would have confiscated
it under various pretexts.</p>

<p>Such was the administration of Korea for
centuries. This was the condition of public
life. Both action and thought were tainted.
This corruption of officialdom not only drove<span class="pagenum">[206]</span><a name="index206"></a>
people to beggary, but also poisoned the public
morals.</p>

<p>The people were no longer capable of governing;
they could only suffer patiently.</p>

<p>If government and administration were in
such a lamentable condition, justice was even
more contemptible. Bribery, perjury, and
treachery were of daily occurrence. Envy and
greed demanded and secured their victims. To
be possessed of property was sufficient cause
for being denounced and for confiscating the
belongings of the owner, and the victim was
very grateful indeed if his life was spared. The
administration of justice in Korea was originally
patriarchal. Any dispute between two parties
was submitted to the <i>elders</i> of the village. The
local council was the court of first instance.
In case of non-agreement the mandarin was
appealed to. The governor had to decide complicated
cases. The supreme court was the
minister of justice himself, and the final appeal
lay to the king, who, here likewise, had absolute
power in rendering justice. He condemned or
pardoned at his pleasure.</p>

<p>Tradition has preserved some of the quaint
ways employed to obtain the king's good graces
or attention. As it was an impossibility to get
into the palace of the king, and he never quitted
it, a large drum was placed before the gate, and
the applicant used to beat this drum in order to<span class="pagenum">[207]</span><a name="index207"></a>
attract the royal attention.</p>

<p>Another way was to light a bonfire upon the
top of the surrounding hills in the hope of the
king perceiving it and dispatching one of his
messengers to the spot, by whom the petitioner
could send his papers to his majesty.</p>

<p>Criminal cases were heard before the military
authorities.</p>

<p>Here also the system was very much the same,
and the procedure was equally defective. The
way cases were tried was not only one-sided,
but shockingly unjust. The saddest part of
judicial administration was the way of obtaining
the accused person's confession. Torturing is,
even now, the prevailing practice, and in this,
as in many other things, Korea has entirely
followed China's example.</p>

<p>Considering the various kinds of torture, their
inventive powers seem to have been inexhaustible.
The most cruel torture, like the crushing
of the knees or the use of red-hot irons, was
prohibited long ago, and the new law ordered
them to be entirely abolished; but I am afraid
some of the methods of obtaining the desired
evidences are still terrible.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the notorious dungeons
of <i>Canton</i> will find the Korean prisons similar
to them. Generally the courtyards of the
magistrates are used for guarding the convicts.
Stables are crammed with prisoners&mdash;mostly<span class="pagenum">[208]</span><a name="index208"></a>
innocent. Furniture is a thing unknown, and
so are all means of cleanliness.</p>

<p>In the Yamen of Judicature at Seoul I saw
a few small private cells reserved for the better
class. The inmate of one of these was a venerable-looking
white-haired gentleman. He was,
so the prison warder informed me, one of the
wealthiest bankers in the town. "He squeezed,"
as he put it, "and now the mandarin is squeezing
him."</p>

<p>Attorneys-at-law and jurists were not wanting,
but in most cases the number of witnesses
and their evidence was decisive&mdash;there being
always any number of them at hand. In fact,
giving evidence meant a living to a portion of
the community, who favoured those who paid
best.</p>

<p>The methods of punishment also varied. In
most cases fines were imposed, which formed
one of the principal sources of revenue to the
authorities. Imprisonment was rarer. In order
to save the expenses of keeping prisoners who
could not pay a fine, these were often given a
chance to escape, or disappeared by some other
means.</p>

<p>Capital crimes were tried by a criminal court.
Decapitation was carried out in various ways
according to social position. <i>Lèse-majesté</i> and
treason were likewise dealt with by special
authorities. In this respect severity knew no<span class="pagenum">[209]</span><a name="index209"></a>
bounds. With the guilty person all the members
of his family had to suffer. More than
once whole clans, which were suspected of being
traitors or rebels, were extirpated. Hundreds
of persons perished through being falsely accused
of crimes.</p>

<p>Such was the judicature in days gone by, and
no wonder that the people lost faith in judges
whose sense of justice was of the lowest standard.
Things seem to be improving, but a less cruel
death implies cruelty all the same.</p>


<p class="center ">V</p>

<p>How did Korea educate her sons that her rule,
her justice, and her people sank so low? is a
question that involuntarily suggests itself.</p>

<p>We must at once point out that there existed
no such thing as <i>public education</i>; as regards <i>public
instruction</i>, Korea entirely followed the Chinese
system. As in the Yellow Empire, it was only
the successful passing of the various university
examinations that qualified for public positions
and Government offices. Here also training
was purely classical. But while in China the
national masters&mdash;Confucius and Menzius&mdash;were
studied, Korea, without any regard for
her history or literature, adopted the ready
material in an unaltered form. Her own authors<span class="pagenum">[210]</span><a name="index210"></a>
thus found no field for their labours, and even
if endowed with talent they were unable to
develop it. This condition was in many respects
similar to that prevalent in Europe in the Middle
Ages, when colleges paid more attention to
Greek and Latin than to their national language,
and when students knew more about the history
of Hellas and Rome than of their own country.</p>

<p>The Chinese system of examination is so well
known that it does not require any explanation.
Prior to the final examination the students
gather in Pekin. There they are walled in in
small cells at the examination hall, entirely
isolated from the outer world.</p>

<p>Korean youths proceeded to Seoul. From
the remotest parts of the country they came, and
it was there decided whether they were qualified
for office or not.</p>

<p>The Chinese system is perfectly democratic
in its ground principles, granting the same
right to every student and considering only his
knowledge. In Korea, where, quite differently
from China, there is an aristocracy of birth,
only the sons of this privileged class competed
for the principal offices. But in this instance
too, as in most other things that affected public
life, corruption manifested itself. Those who
paid the highest examination fees won the
highest offices.</p>

<p>The Korean is probably one of the Tartar<span class="pagenum">[211]</span><a name="index211"></a>
languages, although its grammar shows many
analogies with that of the Dravidian tongues of
Southern India. It is mostly spoken by the
common people, whilst the court, nobles, and
mandarins employ Chinese. As a matter of
fact, the latter is the official language of the
country, and the records and proclamations of
the King, the edicts of the mandarins, and the
judgments of the courts are all in Chinese.
No doubt Korea's long vassalage to China accounts
for this; but the Chinese, as spoken in
Korea, is almost a dialect, and could scarcely
be understood by the Celestials, who, as is well
known, are themselves often at a loss to understand
each other. For Chinese differs even more
in different provinces than some of the Latin
languages, like, for instance, Spanish from
Italian.</p>


<p class="center ">VI</p>

<p>The present Emperor, Li Hsi, is a man of but
little over fifty, and has reigned for just forty
years. The son of Li Cheng Ying, he succeeded
his brother, Li Ping, in 1864. During his
minority his father, Tai Wen Kun, assumed the
regency, which lasted till 1873. A man of
strong will and boundless ambition, he used
every means, permissible or otherwise, to further
his own ends. Of narrow judgment and of<span class="pagenum">[212]</span><a name="index212"></a>
most reactionary views, he has been the cause
of much misfortune to his country. He opposed
every innovation and reform, hated everything
that was not Korean, and instigated the persecution
of the Christians, causing many hundreds
to be killed. The young Emperor held entirely
different opinions, but all his attempts to introduce
advanced ideas have been checked by the
party of reaction. Hardly had he commenced
his reign when he was asked by his own father
to commit suicide. Later on Tai Wen Kun
began intriguing against the Empress, fearing
her influence over the Emperor, and he was so
nearly successful in a scheme to murder her that
she only escaped with her life by hiding for a
whole year. She was believed to be dead, and
mourning was worn by the whole country.
Finally public opinion became so enraged
against this unnatural father-in-law that he
was banished from Korea. His supporters,
however, were still numerous enough to be a
cause of trouble, and in 1884 they broke into
insurrection, and the Emperor, in his turn, had
to flee, escaping on the shoulders of a slave.
Shortly afterwards, during a state ceremony,
a bomb of the most modern construction exploded,
killing one of the ministers and some
of the escort. Tai Wen Kun was not present
at this ceremony!</p>

<p>It was in the revolution of 1895 that the<span class="pagenum">[213]</span><a name="index213"></a>
Empress lost her life. Her palace was surrounded
by rebels, she was stabbed, and then
her body was burnt in an open space before the
palace. The Emperor was more fortunate.
Hidden in a sedan-chair he was taken to the
Russian Legation, where he remained a guest
for a prolonged stay. It would, however, be
impossible to give an account of all the intrigues
and plotting during the Emperor's forty years'
reign. Poison has been found in the food, the
palace has been set fire to, murderers have been
found hidden in it; in short, it would require a
whole chapter to describe the narrow escapes the
Emperor has had. But even what I have said
will show that Korean sovereigns are not always
to be envied! Yet after the Japanese war of
1894 the King (for till then he had been only a
king, the vassal of China) declared his land to
be independent of Chinese control, and elevated
himself to the rank of emperor. Such are life's
ironies.</p>

<p>But if the Emperor's public career has not been
very glorious, his family life has proved even less
happy. He lost his wife, a woman of more than
average ability and to whom he was devoted,
in a terrible manner as we have seen. The
Crown Prince has always been unsatisfactory and
of no political importance. The second royal
prince, who is unquestionably clever and enterprising,
is considered a dangerous innovator,<span class="pagenum">[214]</span><a name="index214"></a>
and so strong is the feeling against him in his
father's palace that he is obliged for the safety
of his life to live in America.</p>

<p>The question who will succeed Li Hsi interests
everybody in Korea, and is the occasion of much
plotting and intrigue, but I am afraid it is one
of the problems which no one can answer or
even guess at!</p>


<p class="center ">VII</p>

<p>The home life of any country is always of the
deepest interest. Old memoirs and diaries
never fail to fascinate, more especially in the
case of a country almost entirely unknown,
whose habits and customs will surely be so
modified as to disappear altogether, and it is
therefore well to preserve the memory of them
for the coming generations.</p>

<p>A Korean home, however flimsy it may appear,
is a regular stronghold. It has its own traditions,
and its inhabitants form a regular community
of their own. Its rule is patriarchal
and its organization entirely Oriental. Divided
into two distinct parts, the front is occupied by
the male, and the inside reserved for the female
sex. However small the house may be, this rule
is strictly observed; even though the division
may sometimes be only a sheet of paper, its
moral strength is as great as the ramparts of a<span class="pagenum">[215]</span><a name="index215"></a>
castle. Conventions are stronger than stone
walls.</p>

<p>In order to enable the reader to form some
idea of Korean family life, I will give a
passing notice of some of the habits, customs,
and institutions, such as marriage, education,
occupations and recreations, festivities and
funerals.</p>

<p>The condition of women in the Land of the
Morning Calm is abominable, for they are considered
as mere slaves, with no privileges or
rights whatever.</p>

<p>In the upper classes the children of the two
sexes, as soon as they reach the age of eight or
ten, are separated from each other, the boys
being removed to the front part of the house
where the father lives, whilst the girls are left
with their mother at the back.</p>

<p>It is considered very bad form for brothers
and sisters to associate with each other. The
inevitable consequence is that family life, as we
understand it, has no existence there.</p>

<p>The Korean regards his wife as a being far
below him, and would not think for a moment
of consulting her on anything of consequence.
Although man and wife live under the same
roof they are practically aliens to each other.
But strange to say, though women in Korea
have no rights, either social or within their own
family circle, they are outwardly respected and<span class="pagenum">[216]</span><a name="index216"></a>
addressed in terms of high esteem.</p>

<p>If we consider that the bride has innumerable
duties to observe towards her consort, while he
has none towards her, it seems only natural that
the number of happy unions is strictly limited.
But notwithstanding the abnormal relations
that exist between the parents, the children
are brought up by the mother to respect their
father deeply. Disrespect towards the mother
is of no consequence, but insubordination to
the father is severely punished. In prison, sickness,
or old age, a father can always rely on the
assistance and support of his son. No virtue
in Korea is esteemed more than filial devotion.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of a Korean marriage is that it
is a matter of interest to every one except the
parties mostly concerned, who see one another
for the first time at the beginning of the ceremony.
The parents and friends arrange the
match, in accordance with their own interests,
and if both parties agree and the bargain is
concluded, the formalities are of the simplest.
There is no religious ceremony and no legal
contract. Early in the morning the best man
arrives to tie the bridegroom's pigtail in a
knot on the top of his head, and this not only
remains for ever as an outward and visible sign
of his condition, but entitles him to be treated
as a man and to enter public life. He may be
a mere child, just over ten years of age, but he<span class="pagenum">[217]</span><a name="index217"></a>
has no longer any right to play with his friends
and must choose his associates among old men&mdash;octogenarians
they may be. He has all civil
rights and is expected to behave accordingly.
If, on the contrary, a man is unable to afford the
luxury of a home and a wife, he may reach the
age of fifty, but he must still wear his pigtail down
his back, has none of the advantages of a citizen,
and is expected to play with kites, marbles, and
such-like, and any folly he may commit is excused,
as would be the naughtiness of a baby,
who is not responsible for his actions.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony itself is most simple.
There is no going to the registry office or to church.
The whole function consists of a procession,
when the bride and bridegroom are conducted
by their respective relations to a dais; there
they are put face to face, and see each other for
the first time, look at each other, bow, and the
knot is tied indissolubly. The mutual surprise
sometimes must be rather unexpected. But,
whether agreeable or not, it is considered very
bad taste to show any emotion. Without exchanging
a single word, a few minutes afterwards
the young bride is conducted to her home, where
she is cloistered for ever. Social etiquette demands
that the bridegroom shall return to the
company of his young bachelor friends for a
few days, which are passed in festivities, if not
orgies. A honeymoon is unknown, and wedding<span class="pagenum">[218]</span><a name="index218"></a>
trips have never been instituted. The
young wife becomes more or less a head servant
to her mother-in-law, and no visible change is
introduced into the husband's daily routine.
If married life begins in such extraordinary
conditions, it remains equally ill-balanced all
through life. The husband has everything,
the wife nothing; she has not even a name.
And yet, though legally a nonentity, socially,
if clever, she can attain to a certain position.
Unseen, unknown, and nameless, in a hidden
corner of the women's quarter, she can receive
her lady friends, get all the news of the outer
world, and send messages by her slaves. There
have been cases when women had even decisive
political influences, and, like spiders, ambushed
in corners, spread their nets.</p>


<p class="center ">VIII</p>

<p>The main occupation of the Korean is agriculture.
It is the ground which produces everything
that is necessary for life, and it is the
ground, also, which is taxed principally to
furnish the necessary funds for the Government.
The methods of cultivation are exceedingly
primitive, but the soil itself is so extremely
fertile, and the irrigation so good, that the
crops are quite sufficient. The women share<span class="pagenum">[219]</span><a name="index219"></a>
in the cultivation of the fields, besides which
they do all the domestic work, which is no mean
task if we take into consideration that many
functions performed in other countries by
tradesmen must here be performed by them,
such as the cutting of the flax, the preparing
and weaving and the making of it into garments&mdash;so
that they are field labourers, manufacturers,
weavers, tailors, and finally washerwomen
to their own husbands and households.
It is the same with all the food. The poor
women must first grow the rice and beans, then
cut and dry them, pound them, and lastly cook
them. But the principal occupation of the
women of Korea is the preparing of their husbands'
suits of clothes. A Korean has generally
two suits of white linen, each of which he wears
in turn for a week. These suits are not sewn,
but stuck together, and every week the suit that
was worn the week before must be taken to
pieces, washed, and then glazed by beating,
which last occupies almost a whole week.</p>

<p>The recreations of the women are very few,
and, in fact, they are treated as slaves to their
husbands. The men, on the contrary, have all
kinds of amusements. The two great national
sports are shooting with bows and arrows, and
flying of kites. They are very fond of open-air
gatherings, and arrange most delightful picnics,
where they entertain their friends, and engage<span class="pagenum">[220]</span><a name="index220"></a>
professional singers and dancers to amuse them.
These singers and dancers are women who form
a separate caste. Westerners find it difficult
to appreciate Korean music, but I could not
help liking its quaint cadence and plaintive
melancholy. The songs mostly treat of historical
legends and reminiscences of old days,
but some, of course, are lyric. Korean dancing,
on account of its dignity and calm, is by far the
most plastic and rhythmical of all Oriental
worship of Terpsichore.</p>

<p>Among the old customs, birthday festivities
occupy the first place, particularly when a man
attains his sixtieth year. On that day he becomes
an object of admiration to the whole
community, having been spared by Fate to such
an age. After this day whatever he may say
is listened to with great respect, even if his advice
is not always followed.</p>

<p>But of all the social institutions funerals play
the most important part. These last for days,
or weeks, and even sometimes for a whole
month, and mourning is observed for several
years. And this observance is strict in Korea.
One may even say that a mourner is buried
alive, for he must cover his face, and, if he
meets his friends in the street, he may not
stop to speak to them or shake hands. During
my stay in Seoul one of the late Empress's relations,
General Ming, died, and I never saw<span class="pagenum">[221]</span><a name="index221"></a>
a more magnificent pageant than his funeral.
The cortège was over a mile long, and led by
paid weepers. As it wound its way along, it
was the most extraordinary conglomeration of
riders, dancers, children, mourners, officials,
torch, lantern, and flag bearers, and, in fact,
it seemed to absorb the whole population of
Seoul.</p>

<p>Children do not receive too much attention
in this far-away country. The little girls soon
share in the housework, and the boys leave
their mothers when they are about six, being
sent first to school and then to the men's quarters,
where they are carefully secluded from
any kind of woman's society, even from that of
their own sisters.</p>

<p>Any one who is interested in Korean children
will have an opportunity of studying their
national characteristics and natural abilities
in the schools, of which there are a great many
in Korea. Besides the old-fashioned Primary
Schools, there are the Chinese Classical Schools,
Missionary Schools, and, last but not least,
the different National Schools for Interpreters.
There are several English, even more Japanese
and Russian, all of which undoubtedly will be
of some use; and there is even a German School,
and, of course, a French Interpreters' School.
I must say I was deeply interested to see the
scholars, neatly dressed in white cotton, sitting<span class="pagenum">[222]</span><a name="index222"></a>
with Oriental patience at their desks, and pronouncing
with the greatest assiduity the unpronounceable
and to them unintelligible syllables.
I admired the endurance and self-control
of the children. If they are not quick and have
not the imaginative capacity of a Japanese
child, they are good, even if not so deep thinkers
as the Chinese.</p>

<p>The houses in Korea are very small and offer
but little comfort. Most of them have not more
than two rooms, exclusive of the kitchen.
Three-roomed dwellings are very uncommon, and
without exception are most scantily furnished.
The roadside inns naturally are of the most
primitive kind, and visitors are expected to bring
their own provisions and bedding with them.</p>

<p>The staple food consists of rice and a few
vegetables; people with some means eat occasionally
a little meat or fish. Milk and butter
are unknown. Beef is difficult to obtain, except
in the capital. There is no mutton, but plenty
of dog's flesh.</p>

<p>The principal beverage is made of fermented
rice. Koreans, like Chinese, are fond of their
pipes, and smoke a great deal.</p>

<p>Their dress is very ample. To be smart, you
must wear two or three pairs of trousers, as
many shirts, and four or five kaftans made of
white linen. Sandals are the principal foot-gear.</p>

<p>Chess is one of their popular games. High<span class="pagenum">[223]</span><a name="index223"></a>
and low are alike enthusiasts. In fact, the
Koreans have almost as high a reputation for
skill in the game as the Chinese.</p>

<p>They are also fond of card-playing. Gambling
seems to be in the blood of the Yellow races.
There is no country where card-sharpers drive
so brisk a business as in Korea.</p>

<p>In outdoor sports the Korean does not excel.
His disinclination to physical effort is too strong
and his nature is altogether too lethargic for
violent exertion. Such mild diversions as kite-flying
and archery he sometimes does indulge in,
and, if so, shows no little proficiency.</p>

<p>Game is plentiful, but energy rare, and so we
do not find many types of the shikari of India,
but more of the trapper class.</p>

<p>The Koreans are a musical people. Every
village has its choir&mdash;its amateur musical society.
With them songs are largely used as an accompaniment
to the dance. Here, at last, the
Korean awakes.</p>

<p>The theatre proper is not represented in this
country, but they have dramatic performances
of a kind.</p>

<p>Recitations are given by a single performer,
who himself plays all the characters of the story.
It reminds one somewhat of the Homeric rhapsodists,
or the medieval jongleurs.</p>


<p class="center ">IX</p>

<p>The last quarter of the nineteenth century has<span class="pagenum">[224]</span><a name="index224"></a>
brought about some unexpected changes in
Korea. The rigid isolation is gradually vanishing.
Not even Chosen is able to conceal from
the outer world her hidden and Hermit Land.</p>

<p>The first breach was made by the United States
Navy. Commodore Shufeldt was the first representative
of a Western Power to conclude a
treaty with her. A year later the Anglo-Korean
commercial agreement was ratified. Then the
other European Powers came in their turn to
establish diplomatic relations there. In the
meantime the prejudice against the foreigner
is losing a good deal of its virulence. The first
steps towards international intercourse had been
made.</p>

<p>These relations with foreign countries promise,
above all, to be advantageous to commerce and
industry; and considering the comparatively
short period during which this influence has
been at work, and the primitive conditions of
locomotion, foreign trade is making unexpected
progress. The receipts of the foreign Customs
are steadily increasing, and whilst the returns
of 1893 amounted to 7,986,880 yen, in 1898
they reached the sum of 24,702,237 yen. The
latest statistics show the Customs revenues as
£122,783. The <i>total</i> import of the last year<span class="pagenum">[225]</span><a name="index225"></a>
represented £1,382,381, and the exports £846,034.</p>

<p>Besides the capital, <i>Seoul</i>, <i>Chemulpo</i>, <i>Fusan</i>,
<i>Gen-San</i>, <i>Mokpo</i>, <i>Chinampo</i>, <i>Masampo</i>, <i>Kunsan</i>,
and <i>Song-ching</i> are being opened to trade.
The general commerce is almost exclusively in
the hands of Japanese and Chinese. In this
respect Japan has made extraordinary progress
during the last few years. In 1897 her imports
amounted to 1,911,851 yen, and those of England
were 3,713,907 yen. Four years later the
Japanese trade increased to 2,844,815 and
England's dropped to 2,853,866. Since the
Commercial Exhibition at Osaka, Japan's
trade with Korea has advanced even more, so
that, for instance, cotton goods, once imported
exclusively from Manchester, are now replaced
by the fabrics of Nippon. The latter seem to
be in a more advantageous position, for, considering
that the distance between Japan and
Korea is inconsiderable and the wages in these
two countries are only one-sixth of those in
English manufacturing towns, European products
are experiencing more and more difficulty
in competing with the Japanese in Asia. The
shipping trade, too, is in the hands of Japan,
and in the course of last year 3920 vessels with
nearly a million tons of cargo anchored in the
ports of Korea. Besides Japan and England,
there is America that is seeking a new market
for her exports. Of continental European<span class="pagenum">[226]</span><a name="index226"></a>
countries, Germany is represented by the greatest
number of articles, though of small importance
and size, like nails, stove pipes, needles, chemicals,
and aniline dyes. The total imports from Germany
at present scarcely represent a quarter of
a million marks.</p>

<p>The Chinese share the local trade with the
Japanese. The shopkeeper belongs to one or
other of the neighbouring states. As we observed
when referring to the past state of Korea, her
own people possess no commercial instincts.
Their needs are few, and even those are supplied
in their homes. Their clothes are woven
and sewn by their wives. The flax grows
in their gardens. Every house has as much
ground attached to it as suffices, more or less,
for the wants of the family. More than that
is not required. It is owing mainly to this
patriarchal simplicity that, though the soil of
the country is rich, not half of it is under cultivation.</p>

<p>The manner of tilling the soil is rather primitive.
Up to this day wooden ploughs are used.
Threshing is done by ordinary poles. Agricultural
implements are unknown.</p>

<p>In spite of her fertile valleys, favourable
climate, and cheap labour, Korea is not agriculturally
developed. Of its products, rice
takes the first place. There is also plenty of
wheat, barley, oats, and beans. The most<span class="pagenum">[227]</span><a name="index227"></a>
profitable plant is <i>gin-sen</i>, which has already been
described.</p>

<p>The principal wealth of Korea is undoubtedly
stored in its mines. The amount of ore contained
in the mountains of the country is prodigious.
There are numerous ancient gold and
silver mines, although their working was prohibited
by law. Since the conclusion of the
international treaties some of them have been
taken over by foreign companies, and already,
during the last few years, have produced considerable
profits. In 1897 the export in gold
amounted to 2,004,049 yen, in 1901 to 4,993,351
yen. But under the present conditions it is
impossible to ascertain the exact amount. The
mountains in the north-eastern part of the
country are the richest in gold. The capital
invested is mostly German and Belgian.</p>

<p>In addition to gold and silver, there are copper,
iron, and coal mines in working, but commercial
enterprise is rather handicapped by the want
of means of communication.</p>


<p class="center ">X</p>

<p>Until recently Korea was not only almost
devoid of railways, but had scarcely any roads.
Transport by means of carts is to this day exceptional&mdash;oxen
and pack-horses only being<span class="pagenum">[228]</span><a name="index228"></a>
employed. Endless strings of caravans cover
the whole length of the land. Seeds, timber,
fuel, metal, and stones&mdash;everything is carried
by cattle to its destination. But human labour
is even more general and much cheaper than
animal labour. It is still the man's shoulder
that carries most of the load and burden. What
a Korean can carry is almost incredible. Besides
heredity it is only through long training that he
has acquired such exceptional strength.</p>

<p>One of the most ancient organizations of
Korea is the Pedlars' Guild. It was founded
centuries ago. There are families who for
generations have known no other occupation
than carrying the miscellaneous pack from one
part of the country to another. They wander
over hills and dales from morning till night.
Like their ancestors they migrate continually.
It is little wonder that they should have known
the inner state and life of the country better
than anybody else. They were the carriers of
news in Korea, and represented the Press of
their land, and their influence and power still
prevail. Public opinion finds in them its most
direct interpreter. There is no movement, outbreak,
or revolt in which they do not participate.
The most important messages are conveyed
through the pedlars, and it is their guild
that nourishes the flames of all rebellions.</p>

<p>In Korea there are several fine rivers. The<span class="pagenum">[229]</span><a name="index229"></a>
<i>Han</i>, watering the central provinces of the
country, and the <i>Yalu</i> in the north, are the two
principal ones. During a few months of the year
both are frozen. Neither of them is used as a
waterway. The traveller who is fond of adventures
hires a fishing-barge, engages a dozen fishermen,
and taking with him some old furniture and
provisions, tries to make himself comfortable in
that Noah's ark. Steamers are unknown on the
rivers.</p>

<p>Railways are now in a somewhat more advanced
stage. Between Chemulpo and Seoul
there is a regular train service, and the short
distance of twenty-six miles can be covered with
Western comfort.</p>

<p>Japan is at present engaged in building the
great southern line as far as Fusan. A French
company has obtained the concession to build
the northern line. On the other hand, the work
of a private company on the line leading towards
Manchuria is making little headway.
Still, it is only a matter of time for Korea to
become a network of railways. Then her harbours
will be the natural gates of Eastern Asia.
Her bays in the south are always free from ice,
making most excellent ports, and capable of
harbouring any number of ships. Chemulpo,
but more particularly Fusan, the extreme
southern point of the peninsula, must necessarily
become one of the termini and one of the principal<span class="pagenum">[230]</span><a name="index230"></a>
emporiums of the whole continent. I do
not think that those who look upon it as the
Shanghai of the future are mistaken.</p>

<p>Besides railways, Seoul possesses also an
electric tramway and electric light. Both concerns
were planned by American companies, and
are said to be very profitable. The new Mint
is also organized on European principles. The
standard money is the Japanese yen; the brass
rings used formerly as small coins are being replaced
by the nickel sen. The various commercial
articles are steadily undergoing changes,
and manufactured goods are ousting the homemade
products of the small shops. Each day
supplies new things and ideas. Each week
marks another step on the road to progress.
The work is slow, being rendered difficult by
many obstacles from within and without, but it
cannot now be stopped in its natural course.</p>

<p>Korea is at present in her first stage of transition.
The old system has collapsed, and a new
order must be inaugurated. Most striking to
the stranger are the antagonisms of the present
day. Almost everything is in a state of metamorphosis,
and it is curious to notice institutions
of past centuries by the side of recent reforms.
Through the ancient city gate electric
cars are passing, and in the vicinity of the
gabled pagoda can be seen the chimney of a
factory. Day by day some Western institutions,<span class="pagenum">[231]</span><a name="index231"></a>
customs, and ideas are being adopted.
It looks like gradual advancement.</p>


<p class="center ">XI</p>

<p>It is barely some decades since Korea opened
her doors to foreigners, and even in this short
time she has introduced innovations which have
shaken her to her foundations, and I fear even
greater changes are awaiting her in the near
future. Her ancient suzerain, China, has retired
from her political arena, but Japan has taken
even stronger hold of the country than ever
before, and a new element has been introduced
into the field by the occupation by Russia of
Manchuria and the Yalu. Such was the condition
of the country when in 1894 the war broke
out between China and Japan. Korea obtained
her independence without participating in any
way in the great fight. Her king became an
emperor. But all these changes were only superficial.
A new internal administration could not
be consolidated in a few days, and Korea's independence
is only on the protocol.</p>

<p>The freedom of Korea was, as we saw, proclaimed
with great pomp just at the moment
when she had the least chance of making use of
that unexpected independence. Surrounded by
enemies, she had neither the moral strength nor<span class="pagenum">[232]</span><a name="index232"></a>
the military force to maintain it. She was bound
to follow the advice of one or the other of her
neighbours; in fact, it was only by showing
herself to be of no use to her allies that she
could ensure her very existence. One day it
was the Chinese, the next the Japanese, then
the Russians. She has always been a mere
instrument in the hands of these Powers. Their
influence has changed very rapidly without any
apparent cause. Which of her attachments has
been the most sincere, who can say? The
manifestations of both were equally ostensible
and complete, and the Koreans went so far as to
proclaim their adherence by adopting the uniform
of the favoured country for their soldiers,
and the inhabitants of Seoul have had the pleasure
of seeing their army parading the main
streets first in the uniform of Cossacks, and then
in that of Nippon.</p>

<p>Ever since the latter part of the nineties
Japan has been showing remarkable activity.
She has invested considerable capital in the
country, opened banks, founded large commercial
firms, built railways, and established a
regular steamship service. She goes even farther
and is endeavouring to instil fresh life into the
people. She is trying to remodel the Korean
government on Japanese principles. As to the
army of (nominally) eighty thousand soldiers, of
which nearly eight thousand are stationed in<span class="pagenum">[233]</span><a name="index233"></a>
Seoul, it is being drilled by Japanese officers
and supplied with European rifles and uniforms.
Japan is establishing modern schools, and desires
to transform young and old alike.</p>

<p>During my visit Russian influence contended
with Japanese for the mastery, but in the midst
of all these antagonistic fluctuations it is
scarcely possible to speak of political convictions.
The people dislike the Russians as
much as they detest the Japanese. They resemble
a man in danger of drowning, who
stretches out his hand to his enemy, in the
vain hope of not being submerged in the floods.
Public men are divided into a great many
parties and form different political groups.
Some even belong to the most reactionary
of the time, while others are more favourably
disposed to progress, and all of them are open
to conviction where personal advantage is concerned.
If the dislike of foreign nations is
intense, the hatred of their compatriots who
are attached to other political factions is still
greater. And when the national apathy and
indolence are broken through by animosity to
rivals, the people become blind to reason, cruel,
and bloodthirsty. They have no self-control,
as they have never been trained to a higher
moral standard, and there is no education such
as will develop their better qualities. Among
all the puzzles of the present day in Korea, certainly<span class="pagenum">[234]</span><a name="index234"></a>
the most important is how to bring up
the rising generation. The conditions, not only
of Korea but of the neighbouring states, being
entirely changed, her old methods are of no
practical use for the present situation. The
future requires a different system. In order to
face the difficulties of the present, they must
bring up their children to be men; and I have
been most interested to note how the children
respond to a better method of training. During
my stay in the country I visited again and again
native, foreign, and missionary schools, and
came to the conclusion that the Koreans are
not lacking in the mental qualities which are
required by our Boards of Education. I listened
to boys of fourteen and fifteen, not only translating
the classics as well as the children in our
schools do, but, what was more exceptional,
they showed a real pleasure in dealing with
deeper questions, where logical thought and
sequence of ideas were requisite. They like to
study, and, to my great astonishment, I was
told by the rector of our seminary that, during
the vacations, many of the boys go on with the
next year's course.</p>

<p>Their moral training is not very difficult
either. The children are docile, obedient, and
good-natured, and are most amenable to religious
principles. Catechists have a high opinion
of their catechumens, who take deep interest<span class="pagenum">[235]</span><a name="index235"></a>
in theological doctrine. As a rule, they evince
a real desire to be better acquainted with
spiritual matters, and, if they become Christians,
conscientiously adhere to their faith and
observe the religious rites. All who have lived
in Korea are of the same opinion&mdash;that this unexplored
country and its backward people need
before all cultivation and education, and it
depends entirely on those who take this great
work of development into their hands whether
it shall become a flourishing land and its people
happy or not. And in that case, instead of
the country being the seat of disturbance and
war, and the inhabitants mere instruments in
the hands of their enemies, the land of the
Morning Calm may deserve its name and become
a guarantee for the commercial prosperity and
the peace of the Far East.</p>

<p>Such was the general situation at the moment
of the outbreak of the Japanese-Russian war.</p>


<p class="center ">XII</p>

<p>It is evident that Korea is yet incapable of
self-government. She is dependent on one or
the other neighbour. Since China fell out of
the ranks of conquering Powers Japan has taken
up arms as she did centuries ago. To-day it is
she who is aiming at ruling Eastern Asia, as if<span class="pagenum">[236]</span><a name="index236"></a>
it were her mission to awaken the peoples of
Asia and to instil Western civilization into them.
The movement is of great interest and of more
import than we should dare to believe. Its
significance is incalculable. Whether Japan will
be the master who is to transform the Asiatic
races is another puzzling problem. Already a
considerable number of young Chinese are frequenting
Japanese high schools and colleges.
Delegates are being sent from Pekin, at the
expense of the Government, to Japanese commercial
and industrial institutions to study and
to become acquainted with modern ideas.</p>

<p>Korea is face to face with similar problems of
transformation. Who is to secure her definite
leadership&mdash;Japan or Russia? The present war
is more than a boundary dispute; it means the old
struggle between the white and yellow races for
the hegemony of Asia. On whichever side success
ultimately lies, on that of Russia or of Japan,
let all those who know Korea and are interested
in her fate, hope that the conquerors will fulfil
the duties victory involves. The little country
deserves that her rulers should earnestly study
her conditions and seek to improve them.
Even from a merely utilitarian standpoint it will
prove a better policy to develop and help than
to exploit to excess or to oppress her. It is
just as important that her people, who ever
since their infancy have been the victims of<span class="pagenum">[237]</span><a name="index237"></a>
cruel foes and the prey of bad government,
should be elevated to a higher standard.</p>

<p>For those who like to gather knowledge, not
only about the outward circumstances of foreign
countries but also about their inner life, it will
be of interest to know that in spite of their
degradation Korea's people have preserved unimpaired
the sensitiveness of their mind. They
are by no means insensible to lofty ideas. They
are even capable of showing some enthusiasm
for higher ideals. There is hardly another
nation in the East which evinces more sincere
appreciation of Christian ethics and doctrines
than the Koreans.</p>

<p>Scarcely half a century has passed since the
first Roman Catholic priests began their work,
and they already number about fifty parishes
and over fifty thousand parishioners. The old
religious hatred is gradually changing into sympathy.
Recently a few orphanages were built
where children, abandoned by their parents, are
being brought up and trained for some useful
vocation.</p>

<p>The people are beginning to conceive clearer
ideas about Christian virtues, and those who
see under what wretched conditions the missionaries
live, in what poor huts they dwell, on
what scanty fare they have to live&mdash;especially
when they realize that these men have left their
own families, homes, and their country to educate<span class="pagenum">[238]</span><a name="index238"></a>
little orphans, to help the needy, and to
nurse the sick, no matter of what creed or sect,
be they pagans or worshippers of the sun or of
ancestors&mdash;regard this self-sacrifice with an
admiration which is general and sincere.</p>

<p>For those who wish to form an estimate of
the intellectual powers of a people, the missionary
schools offer undoubtedly the greatest
facilities. It is there that the natural inclinations,
good or bad, find direct expression. Of
all my surprising experiences in Korea&mdash;a
country rich in surprises&mdash;nothing equalled my
impressions of the new college and seminary at
Yong-Sang. There young people of twelve to
fifteen gave as precise answers to questions put
to them as one could hear in the best European
high schools. And there Korea's primitive children
can express themselves fluently in classical
Latin. It was interesting for me to get an
insight into their capabilities and observe their
industry. For hours they would pore over their
books if the teacher would not call them away
for recreation. With the inherited inclination of
Oriental people for abstract sciences, they enter
with delight and pleasure into any metaphysical
question. I was delighted to hear how
successful their training is, and how easy it is
to form their minds. I saw young Korea in a
new light. There I best realized the force of
the maxim that the future of a nation lies in the<span class="pagenum">[239]</span><a name="index239"></a>
potentialities of its youths and their sound
bringing up. But education can be of value
only when carefully founded on higher morality
and guided by true religion.</p>

<p>With such an education Chosen's children
might hold in their hands one day their country's
independence and prosperity.</p>

<p>Korea's exceptional geographical position, its
natural wealth, and inborn physical strength,
should tend to make her in the extreme Far
East a sort of buffer state, and a bulwark of
international good fellowship and established
peace.</p>

<p>Nations, like individuals, have their moral
codes and vocations. Nemesis must always
overtake evil of every kind, and to the virtuous
alone is granted the palm of victory.</p>

<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"><a name="seoul" id="seoul"></a>IX</p>

<p class="center "><b>SEOUL, THE CAPITAL OF KOREA</b></p>


<p>I have arrived safely in Seoul. It is eventide,
and the moon is just appearing. In
the dimness the most desolate imperial residence
in the world seems still more desolate, more
wretched, miserable, and forlorn.</p>

<p>My sedan-chair is being carried through a
long street, or rather road, of small houses&mdash;but
houses they cannot be called: those I have seen
up to the present can at the best be termed
hovels.</p>

<p>At last we reach the walls of the inner city&mdash;for
till now we have been merely in the outer
town. The wall is ragged and thorny. In front
stand a number of roofed and painted gates.
I almost imagine myself back in Pekin, for the
picture is a replica, but in miniature. I am,
however, unable in the dusk to see how much
smaller it is, only the general effect is the same,
stamped with the familiar Chinese characteristics.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_240.jpg" alt="Seoul" />
<p class="caption">SEOUL<br />"The broad streets seem an immense cemetery, and the mean little flat-roofed houses graves"<br />
[To face page 240]</p></div>

<p>The moon is now shining brightly, but it
shows nothing new in the aspect of the road
within the walls. The main street of Seoul is
as deep in clay and mud as it was at the time<span class="pagenum">[241]</span><a name="index241"></a>
when the "waters dried up." Its houses have
not altered; they are scarcely more than the
clay huts of prehistoric man, his protection
against cold or heat.</p>

<p>The first sight of an unknown country stamps
itself on our minds in a manner unique, and I
requested the bearers of my chair to walk
slowly, for I did not wish to lose my first impression.
There is a fascination in the unknown&mdash;a
wonderful interest attached to the unexpected.
Our wanderings amongst strange peoples
in the streets of a city which we have not
visited before are not for the pen to describe.</p>

<p>Everything that is unknown is mysterious,
until reality tears aside the veil, and so long as
it is built up by our imagination and peopled
by fantastic creations it remains to a certain
extent a City of Dreams.</p>

<p>The streets are gradually getting broader,
and the clay huts grow even more insignificant.
I stop for a moment in the great square, which
may be the centre of the city, but is little more
than a cross-road leading into a few side-streets.</p>

<p>It is scarcely seven o'clock, and yet over all
broods a death-like silence, a peaceful calm, as
complete as one can imagine. The broad streets
seem an immense cemetery, and the mean little
flat-roofed houses graves. One might think it is
All Saints' Day, for on each grave a little lamp
is burning. A lantern hangs from the eaves of<span class="pagenum">[242]</span><a name="index242"></a>
each roof, showing a yellowish flame.</p>

<p>But the people themselves are returning like
ghosts to their homes, each robed in white&mdash;each
and all mute. Without a sound they flit
over the roads of the endless graveyard, until
they disappear into the depths of some one of
the illuminated tombs.</p>

<p>I have never been so impressed by any other
city I have seen as I was by my first sight of
Seoul. As I saw the city just now, by the light
of a November moon, dark, dumb, desolate, and
ghostly, it resembled some fairy city more than
reality; like those storied places sung of in
the poetry of almost every people, the tale of
which is listened to with such rapture by the
little folk of the nursery, who know nothing as
yet of life's seamy side.</p>

<p>Such a town was Seoul to me, the first few
hours after my arrival.</p>

<p>Next morning I was aroused by the sound of
drums and trumpets. But whose? Do they
belong to the ghosts? What can have happened
that the home of silence should have been disturbed
by such an awful uproar?</p>

<p>I hasten to my window. The long street,
the square, every inch of ground, is occupied by
soldiers. These are short and yellow, wearing
a black uniform, the black cloth of which, set
off by a broad red collar and contrasted with
the yellow faces, makes a motley colour-scheme,<span class="pagenum">[243]</span><a name="index243"></a>
almost like a chequered field. The men seem
to like it. If the mixture serves no other purpose
it offers an excellent target for an enemy,
which was probably the idea of its inventors.</p>

<p>The din continues. The trumpets blare, and
these black, red, and yellow little people, like
tin soldiers, keep moving before me; to and fro,
up one street and down another they go, like
stage-property soldiers, now appearing on and
again disappearing from the stage&mdash;always the
same supers; but one would think they were
a mighty army. And all the time the bayonets
flash on the rifle-barrels, whose weight seems
rather too much for the little men. The drums
still beat, and fanfares ring out on the frosty
morning.</p>

<p>What has happened? Has the coronation
not been postponed after all? Is the Emperor
at last inaugurating the long-awaited festivities?</p>

<p>I ring the bell, and a servant, dressed in white,
and wearing a pigtail twisted up in a knot,
enters. His long coat is of linen, his head
covered by a hat of horsehair, which resembles
in shape the wire lid used to protect preserves
from flies.</p>

<p>This quaint servant seems more surprised at
my question than I at his livery.</p>

<p>"But the army has been reorganized by
European officers. It has been taught, in the
Western style, to march, man&oelig;uvre, and kill,<span class="pagenum">[244]</span><a name="index244"></a>
and for the performance of this gay farce new
taxes have been raised. And now you, a
European, coming from the West, ask, with
obvious irony, 'What does this all mean?'"</p>

<p>I can see how amusing the whole situation is,
and what a ludicrous side it has. The fact of
the collar being a few inches deeper, or of the
colour of the tunic, does not alter the character
of the uniform; it is still a distinctive
mark, even in its best form, whether the mechanism
which propels the bullet be new or old
fashioned. The rifle always destroys, and
whether a soldier is a couple of feet taller or not,
whether he has a yellow or a white complexion,
his calling is a rather gloomy one. For do we
not consider that soldier most efficient who destroys
the greatest number of lives?</p>

<p>Dawn now turns into morning, and the doors
of the shops open one by one. Most of them
are only protected for the night by mats or a
few planks.</p>

<p>Later on the customers begin to arrive, all
of them dressed in white. Men and women alike
wear long linen coats (kaftans), and their lined
foot-gear is also of linen; in fact, they are
white from top to toe, excepting the black hat
of horsehair.</p>

<p>Now and again I see a sedan-chair, which,
however, is not larger than a good-sized box,
its occupant huddled up inside. I cannot perceive<span class="pagenum">[245]</span><a name="index245"></a>
any carriage, trap, or horse, in spite of the
growing traffic, which, however, is perfectly
noiseless. Perhaps this may account for the
fact of my still being under the impression of
being in a deserted city.</p>

<p>It is generally on the first day that we catch
the most characteristic traits, or, at any rate,
that the most salient features strike our imagination.
While our perceptive powers are
still fresh, we are able to be impressed by the
smallest peculiarities.</p>

<p>After breakfast I go out for a stroll, and find
in front of me the palace gate, outside which
some soldiers are standing. Beyond it stretches
a long street, towards which I turn. This is the
same thoroughfare which yesterday resembled a
vast graveyard, but the houses now stand open,
as the wooden wall, looking on the street, has
been removed. There are a considerable number
of shops, but small and mean, displaying no
wares that attract my attention. Those of the
cabinet-makers make the best show, consisting
of small chests, inlaid with brass ornamentation,
having large polished locks. These are no
less quaint than they are tasteful. There seems
to be a great demand for them, for in a whole
row I can see nothing else. There is also no
lack of fruit and seeds, but the baskets do not
offer a quarter of the variety of a Chinese grocer.
I do not think I saw any more shops, at least<span class="pagenum">[246]</span><a name="index246"></a>
any that I remarked. They seemed small and
empty, never more than a couple of customers
in them.</p>

<p>What especially attracted my attention was
the large number of sentry-boxes. Every five
or ten yards you came across a box, with
a stubby black-red-and-yellow soldier inside,
armed!</p>

<p>No matter where I turn, there are sentry-boxes
everywhere&mdash;to the right, to the left, in
front and behind me. Can it be a fact that this
army is required to keep these little folk in order?</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>No sooner had I put this question to myself
than I became aware of a disturbance going on&mdash;some
coolies, carrying vegetables, engaged in
a battle royal, and two boys pitching into each
other. But the private stands there unmoved.
His look seems rather to approve than condemn.
He is evidently not intended to keep the peace;
this does not seem to be part of his duties; so the
coolies may fight as much as they like among
the cabbages. (The group, by the way, forms
a pretty picture&mdash;the coolies in white, with
the green loads on their backs, in the thick of
the fray.) The smaller of the boys commences
to cry, as blood is dripping from his forehead;
but the soldier is not affected by the sight
of this either. I wonder if what he just
muttered was that the "Red Cross" was not his<span class="pagenum">[247]</span><a name="index247"></a>
business.</p>

<p>As I went on I heard more screaming and
quarrelling, and witnessed a few more little
skirmishes. It was not until now that I realized
how unaccustomed I was to quarrels and
fights, as in China I never saw one man fighting
another&mdash;they have their thousands of
years of civilization to thank for that.</p>

<p>Later I approach a hall which is being repaired.
It has a pointed roof and broad eaves, similar
to those of the palace at Pekin.</p>

<p>A whole forest of wood is stored up there in
the shape of beams. As I see with what precision
the workmen make the various parts fit
together, without the use of nails, I am delighted
that the traditions of ancient architecture
are not yet extinct.</p>

<p>I am now in the neighbourhood of the Royal
Palace. In front of the main gate is a large
square, which farther on turns into a street,
with public buildings on either side. These are
the Ministerial Offices, where is spun the web
of the Korean Government.</p>

<p>Externally the palace has little to distinguish
it. The façade is rather low, and the walls are
mud-coated, while the gates are not much better,
in the Chinese style, and crowned by tiles.</p>

<p>The gates, which are wide open, lead into a
large inner courtyard, where there are a number
of ordinary and state sedan-chairs. Crowds of<span class="pagenum">[248]</span><a name="index248"></a>
servants, attendants, and coolies, are warming
themselves in the sun, others are playing at
ball, which they kick off and catch with their

[To face page 248]</p></div>

<p>In the middle of the street one meets mandarins
hurrying to their offices, magistrates and
other men of consequence, most of them in
chairs, or rather boxes, carried by two servants.
The vehicle is covered with a cloth, that of
the better class matching in colour the servants'
liveries. I have seen grey and yellow ones also.
These belong to the Korean aristocracy.</p>

<p>The most attractive of all was the "carriage"
of a noble in mourning. His chair had quite
recently been covered with cloth of a yellowish
hue, the same as that worn by his two servants,
their coats reaching nearly to the ground. In
order to give their limbs free play, these had been
split up as far as the waist. But this can be
nothing more than fashion, for not even the whip
would make a Korean hurry. The servants
also wear a broad girdle, tied up in a bow, round
their waists.</p>

<p>When in mourning they wear straw hats, not
black, but shaped like a fair-sized old-fashioned
bread-basket. These have wide sloping brims,
reaching the shoulders, and entirely concealing
the face. In such a weird costume they strongly
resemble yellow mushrooms sprung up on a
summer's day. Straw sandals complete the<span class="pagenum">[249]</span><a name="index249"></a>
costume.</p>

<p>In spite of these strange details and absurd
combinations, the general effect is good; the
colours, the silk-covered chair, straw hat and
sandals, blend harmoniously together. Seen
from a distance, they almost have the appearance
of ivory knick-knacks, such as you see exhibited
for sale in Japanese curio shops.</p>

<p>But I hear a noise in the distance, and from
the direction of the western gate a motley crowd
comes towards me. It must be either a funeral
or a wedding. So far I cannot distinguish which.
The next moment two children detach themselves
from the crowd and seem to lead the procession.
Their dress is glaring, of green, purple,
and scarlet silk, with their dark hair encircling
their foreheads in gleaming plaits. They are
also decked out with flowers and butterflies.</p>

<p>Behind them is carried a large box, painted
red, and polished. It is evidently a wedding,
and this is very likely the dowry. Now follow
the dancers, in pairs, but wide apart from each
other. Their costume&mdash;I cannot describe it!
Almost shapeless, it consisted of skirt over
skirt, kerchiefs, veils, all pell-mell and of every
colour of the rainbow.</p>

<p>I take note of many things which to-morrow
might escape me.</p>

<p>Street life is one ever-flowing stream. In
Seoul, I observe, everybody lives on the thoroughfares,<span class="pagenum">[250]</span><a name="index250"></a>
and this is probably the reason why the
roads are so wide and the dwellings so cramped.
In this trait the Korean is like the Spaniard or
Italian, for he is never so happy as when out
of doors. There he stands on his threshold, or
basking in the sunny courtyards; or he lights
his pipe and strolls up and down for hours.
His carriage is slow and stately. I wonder
where he is going, and what he is thinking
of&mdash;nowhere and of nothing. I should say,
"Il flâne." There is no suitable word in another
language for this aimless meandering. "Loitering"
indicates only physical slowness, nor does
even "to lounge or saunter" exactly convey the
idea. Physical sluggishness and moral vacuum
are not simultaneously connoted by them.</p>

<p>Now and again a private comes by. He is
the coming man! If he learns nothing else in
the barrack-yard, he certainly does learn how
to walk.</p>

<p>His pigtail has been shorn off. At first he
bemoaned it, for this antiquated head-dress of
his embodied a general principle, and with its
departure he was cut adrift from all his old
associations and traditions; but, like the child
he is at heart, he soon forgets his pigtail and its
traditions along with it, and today is proud of
the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>As the man of progress and of the future, he
scorns the white coats, sandals, and hats, of his<span class="pagenum">[251]</span><a name="index251"></a>
countrymen.</p>

<p>On reaching the hotel I find a gentleman
awaiting me; it is the Minister of Great Britain.
He has learnt of my arrival, and is come to offer
me his hospitality, my country not having a
legation in the city.</p>

<p>The Hôtel du Palais in Seoul is new and
fairly well managed, and so I did not wish to
put any one to inconvenience. The bishop being
away, and having no legation, I was anxious
to remain my own master. We never know
when we may become a nuisance to the
kindest of hosts. The pleasantness of a visit,
after all, depends more on circumstances than
on the host or guest.</p>

<p>All this I frankly explained, and in the end
we made a compromise in such a way as not
to disturb our daily programme. I was to be
his guest, but each of us was to attend to his
usual occupations, and we were to meet only
at luncheon time. As for the afternoons, we
left everything to circumstances.</p>

<p>The British Legation, on the other side of
the new palace, is a pretty country mansion,
with a loggia, built on a bank, and enclosed by
a garden. The secretary's house stands in
another part of the grounds, and at the entrance
a pavilion for the guards is in course of construction.</p>

<p>The interior is typically English, the same<span class="pagenum">[252]</span><a name="index252"></a>
as we find it in the houses of the well-to-do
classes, whose root principle is, "My home is
my castle." Among those with whom the family
life is such a fine example of domestic virtues,
the "home" strikes us very forcibly and with
such graciousness. Indeed, the "home" idea is
one of Great Britain's bulwarks.</p>

<p>My room was ready for me, bright and cheerful.
The creeper on the balcony was still green,
and my windows looked out on to the courtyard
of the neighbouring palace.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to the German Consulate,
and passed on the way the Temple of
Heaven&mdash;a pagoda standing on a hill, with a
fair double roof and in front of it a marble altar.</p>

<p>It is a replica, a poor one it is true, of Pekin's
masterpiece, but quite pretty from a scenic
point of view.</p>

<p>From a small house at the corner a very babel
of sound issues forth. It is the inarticulate
mechanical repetition of one chapter&mdash;exactly
the same method our own schoolmasters used
to employ for instilling knowledge.</p>

<p>As the door in the courtyard is open, I enter.
In front of me I find a room, not more than
ten feet square, in which ten or more youngsters
are crowded together. There they sit on the
floor, dressed green instead of white, and their
long hair hanging down in fine plaits.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_252.jpg" alt="The Imperial library in Seoul" />
<p class="caption">THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY IN SEOUL<br />"One of those charming buildings full of originality"<br />
[To face page 252]</p></div>

<p>Each has a big A B C book in his hand.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span><a name="index253"></a>
Every word has a different letter; these they
repeat, and in this way knowledge is driven into
them. They pronounce everything out loud,
moving the upper part of their body to right
and left, backwards and forwards, all the time.</p>

<p>The dominie is seated in front, also squatting
on the floor. His eyes are shielded by goggles
of enormous size, and he wears on his head a
horsehair crown.</p>

<p>He is wisdom personified, outwardly at any
rate, and his thoughts seem to be ranging far
away in the distance; and from his Olympic seat
he casts an indifferent eye on his perspiring
pupils. But, as a famous Chinese pedagogue
says, "Chinese spelling and writing can only
be mastered mechanically; the best scholar
is the jackass."</p>

<p>The German Consulate is a new building, but
by no means as comfortable as the English.
The Consul-General is also entrusted with Austro-Hungarian
affairs, and would look after them
if there were any to look after. But I am
afraid that the Viennese Foreign Office of the
present régime does not quite realize the commercial
interests which it might promote, and
follows strictly the advice of the late Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, Ct. Kálnoky, given to an
enthusiastic youth, "If you want to succeed in
your career and maintain your position when
once acquired, do not forget 'On n'est jamais<span class="pagenum">[254]</span><a name="index254"></a>
en disgrace pour ce qu'on n'a pas fait.'" He
is very courteous, and talks a good deal of Japan,
where he acted as Councillor of the Legation.</p>

<p>From there to the Roman Catholic Mission
is but a few yards. As I enter its iron grilled
gate, my surprise is as great as it is agreeable,
for I see before me a grand cathedral, and on
either side spacious buildings standing in their
own wooded grounds.</p>

<p>It was built on the model of one of the old
cathedrals in the Netherlands&mdash;red brick, Gothic,
a style which, as I invariably avow, I do not like
to find in the East. But this is only a criticism
due to my artistic sense. As a building, nothing
can be said against it, for of its kind it is perfect.
But what struck me most was its cleanliness.
The stone floor was as bright as a mirror.</p>

<p>The bishop was away on circuit, and would not
return for ten days, so Father&mdash;&mdash;, the vicar,
received me, and showed me over the whole
little colony, the school, and convent and orphanage;
but of these I will speak more fully
elsewhere.</p>

<p>As I took my leave the sun was setting. The
peaks of the encircling hills were reflected in
purple tints on the topaz sky. The Mission
down below, in the dell, appeared in a bluish
mist, only the cathedral cresting the hill.</p>

<p>Returning home by a circuitous route, I find
the streets even more thronged than in the<span class="pagenum">[255]</span><a name="index255"></a>
morning. I glance into a few shops, but there
is not much worth seeing. The furriers, who
are engaged in cutting out and sewing a number
of tunics, capes, and fur coats, seem to be the
busiest. There are also a good many jackets
and still more waistcoats without sleeves to protect
the chest and back. Over these are worn
white linen kaftans. No wonder the wearers
look like walking eider-down quilts.</p>

<p>To the right I noticed a tavern, much like
the Chinese roadside inn, and in the large open
stable a row of small rough-haired horses were
standing with straw rugs on their backs. A
coolie was carrying water from the well in two
brass vessels, hanging on the ends of a long pole.
The pole does not, however, rest upon his
shoulders, but is fastened crosswise to his back,
giving man and load the appearance of a living
pair of scales.</p>

<p>Next come some unpretentious little barracks,
which, in their smallness, are after the pattern
of the soldiers, a number of whom are looking
out of the windows. In the absence of any
better occupation, they are chewing pumpkin-seeds.</p>

<p>Now we arrive at the curiosity shops displaying
several porcelain articles, a few of bronze,
many tiles, and a farrago of rubbish.</p>

<p>On the cross-road are some more barracks,
comprised in a long low building, the little men in<span class="pagenum">[256]</span><a name="index256"></a>
front of which were wearing, not only red collars,
but also red dolmans. Here the cavalry are
garrisoned, and a little scrap of a hussar is just
galloping home. This warrior is not a whit
taller than Hop o' my Thumb, his charger scarce
larger than a well-developed calf of two months.</p>

<p>By the side of this toy hussar rattled a formidable
sabre, which seemed in danger of pulling
him down from his horse.</p>

<p>Without that impediment his seat is poor
enough. On his coming nearer I see that the
murderous instrument is an ordinary cavalry
sword. His uniform is the most chequered I
ever saw. The dolman of the Korean hussar
is of a cinnamon colour, his collar and cuffs
emerald-green, and his breeches stripes saffron.
If the pattern of his uniform was the plumage
of a parrot, the imitation is indeed most successful.</p>

<p>I was wandering farther on, when in front of
a gate some dogs nearly knocked me down.</p>

<p>The streets of Seoul, like those of Pekin
and Constantinople, are full of them, but
with this difference, that the dogs here are
well-kept and strong. If a single one of
these starts barking, this signal of some approaching
danger is in a minute responded to
throughout a whole quarter. It was so in my
case. As I came too near the threshold, the
guardian on duty there was under the impression<span class="pagenum">[257]</span><a name="index257"></a>
that I intended to encroach on his domain.
His attitude towards me was anything but
friendly, and not being armed with either stick
or umbrella, I instinctively stooped down to
pick up a stone. This movement on my part,
however, was sufficient to make him retire
summarily into his own courtyard. He was
perfectly in the right, and it only showed what
a faithful watch-dog he was.</p>

<p>The Korean canine race is a subject worthy
of a few words, because it affords some of the
most typical figures in the streets of Seoul. I
must confess I never have seen better-trained
dogs than these. In the streets they are the
meekest of quadrupeds, and as quiet as lambs.</p>

<p>A single word is quite sufficient to make the
Seoul dog scamper home to his doorway. He
knows that it is his duty to be there. He will
lie in the little yard for hours and hours, but
prefers, best of all, to take his ease on the doorstep,
with his head in the street, so as not to
lose sight of any one approaching. He hardly
takes any notice of you, as long as you walk in
the middle of the road. At most he would stare
at dark-clothed people with other than yellow
faces, to the sight of whom he is not accustomed,
for ever since he came into this world he has
seen none other than white kaftans.</p>

<p>But the moment any stranger directs his
steps towards the house, the dog gives a growl<span class="pagenum">[258]</span><a name="index258"></a>
or two, and on further approach barks as loud
as he can. He reserves his attack until you are
within his range, that is to say about a yard
from him. By that time the auxiliary forces
from the neighbourhood have concentrated,
and you have the whole brigade snarling and
yapping at your heels.</p>

<p>This fearsome pandemonium at last brings
the master of the house, or a member of his
family, to the seat of the disturbance, and a
single word, or merely a sign, suffices for Cerberus
to retire to a corner, wagging his tail.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>Darkness has set in. Calm reigns supreme.
The fresh autumnal night is silently spreading
its grey veil of mist over the white city. But
look! is not that the northern light breaking
through the dark? In the direction of Puk-Han
it begins to dawn. The sky unexpectedly
flashes up; its subdued red light is getting more
and more brilliant. Now flames of hundreds
of torches illuminate the atmosphere. Here is
another surprise, as if the many strange phenomena
of the day had not yet reached their
climax.</p>

<p>It is a torchlight procession, the like of which
I have never seen before. Pedestrians, sedan-chairs,
men on horseback, are coming forward
in an endless string. And what a pageant this
is! What effective grouping! The minutest<span class="pagenum">[259]</span><a name="index259"></a>
detail has been carried out with artistic taste.
The smallest traits are wonderfully harmonized,
to enhance the general effect.</p>

<p>The procession is headed by children, dressed
in white from top to toe, wearing bell-shaped
head-gear. Then follow bearers of torchlights
and banners, servants carrying inscriptions
attached to poles, others dangling lanterns, and
behind these another group burning straw plaits.</p>

<p>The next section of the procession consists
of riders, of whom eight are entirely covered by
white cloaks. You would imagine they were
phantoms, if it were not that they are weeping
bitterly. These are the paid mourners, like the
moaning women of ancient Rome; for it is a
native funeral. A member of the Min family
is being taken to his last resting-place. He is
a descendant of a famous clan, a relative of the
late Empress of Korea, so regal pomp is awarded
him. And the funeral procession is really
grand, although all dresses worn therein are of
unbleached linen. The trimmings are for the
most part of paper, but in such striking combinations,
and designed and finished so perfectly,
that we disregard the details and only admire
the general effect. The group of moaning women
is followed by monsters, dressed as guys, such
as gruesome fables are peopled with. One wears
a red, another a yellow, mask; this a green, and
that a blue one. The appearance of all is awe-inspiring,<span class="pagenum">[260]</span><a name="index260"></a>
their heads being adorned with horns,
cockscombs, and crowns. Now more and more
new groups follow, approaching in a stately
way, and disappearing slowly in the darkness
of the night.</p>

<p>How long the procession lasted I could not
ascertain, but some thousand persons must have
marched by ere the two gilt catafalques appeared
on the scene. Both were alike, resembling monumental
pagodas, gabled in many places, designed
with the quaint originality of this people,
and ornamented with all the fullness of their
fancy. The two coffins, prescribed by ancient
traditions, rest on pedestals in the shadow of
high baldachinos. Behind the coffin walks a
person wrapped in sackcloth, suggestive of the
cloth worn over their uniforms by members
of the society of the Misericordia in Italy. The
catafalques and coffins are carried on their
shoulders by thirty-two mourners, proceeding
slowly and rhythmically.</p>

<p>But the pageant is not yet at an end. On
a number of sedan-chairs are heaped up the
personal belongings of the deceased. His clothes,
household furniture, horses, and cows, all follow
him, so that they may be consumed as a burnt-offering
by his grave-side; all in <i>effigy</i>, for they
are but of paper. It is in such cheap counterfeit
that the ancient traditions are being preserved
by the more practical progeny of the<span class="pagenum">[261]</span><a name="index261"></a>
present day. The silver coins, thrown by the
riding "weepers" amongst the crowd, are likewise
make-believe, being really nothing but
small discs of paper. One sedan-chair follows
another; hosts of carriers and servants accompany
the members of the family. There is the
whole tribe; a whole brigade is riding behind the
gabled catafalque. All are covered with sackcloth;
even the mendicant is dressed in white&mdash;the
whole procession is white. And as they turn
round at the top of the hill, the effect of the
picture is unique. The weeping women, the
monsters, the mourners and attendants, the
gigantic catafalques, and the immense crowd,
formed one of the strangest sights I ever contemplated.
The furled banners, dangling inscriptions,
open sunshades, lanterns with dim
lights in the darkness of the night, formed the
quaintest setting. The light of torches, the burning
bunches of bulrushes and straw, are tinting
in a vibrating red the long, white and ghostly
procession. The beating of drums, and the
droning of bagpipes, furnish the music, and the
weeping women the proper chorus. This
strange funeral, in fact, is the most perfect
"danse macabre."</p>

<p>The full moon, fuller than usual, as though
anxious to light up the weird procession, is rising
in a slow and stately manner behind the hills.
Her melancholy rays filter through the night,<span class="pagenum">[262]</span><a name="index262"></a>
her silvery splendour intensifying the ghostliness
of the scene.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>The first day spent in the capital of Korea
is nearing its end. Quietness penetrates the
night&mdash;such profound quietness as can only be
enjoyed in Seoul. The alley leading to the
legation is dark and deserted. And as I walk
home I try to recall to my memory all that I
have perceived and heard; all that was new to
me and striking; all the contrasts and the incoherency
of earliest perceptions.</p>

<p>No guests were bidden to dinner, and when
my host put the question to me, "What do you
think about Seoul?" I was scarcely able to
express my thoughts clearly. What do I really
think about Seoul? What about her people,
her life, physiology, and atmosphere? I will
write it down forthwith, ere <i>knowledge</i> spoils the
glamour of first impressions, whilst every tint
is shining in glaring colour, whilst every detail
can be observed through the microscope of
novelty.</p>

<p>On the last day of my sojourn here, I will
look through these short notes, and, like a
schoolmaster, correct in red ink any mistakes
that may be found therein. Town and people
will then be better known, but the charm of the
first day will vanish for ever.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>THE EMPEROR OF KOREA AT THE
NEW PALACE</b></p>


<p>Since last night we have been in the midst
of revolution; but it seems that a revolution
in Korea is very much like everyday life in
other corners of the earth, and nobody attaches
any importance to it. Everybody pursues his
daily task, the ordinary routine goes on in its
slow and lumbering way. Official life maintains
its sluggish pulsation, and to my astonishment
I even get an invitation to be received in the
course of the afternoon by the Emperor and the
Crown Prince.</p>

<p>It is a calm day, calm in every respect, and
the people of Seoul seem to be at rest, as I am
carried by eight unusually large bearers towards
the New Palace. The little <i>cortège</i> is of a strange
character. My sedan-chair is covered with
green silk, and, with the bearers in dark purple,
makes quite a patch of colour in the whitewashed
streets.</p>

<p>Seoul might be called the white city. The
houses are white, and every living being, young
and old, man and woman, is clad in white cotton.
I should really think that the absence of colour<span class="pagenum">[264]</span><a name="index264"></a>
and sound is the most striking feature of the
Land of the Morning Calm.</p>

<p>The reception takes place at the New Palace.
There are four palaces in Seoul, the Eastern,
Northern, Western, and the one I am just entering.
I have passed a great many delightful
afternoons in their magnificent grounds, forlorn
gardens, quaint summer-houses, and charming
pagodas.</p>

<p>I returned again and again to sketch for
a while, or to admire the once-famous Korean
art, which, I am afraid, has vanished for ever,
like the famous bronze-workers, sculptors, and
cloisonné makers, like the whole once-famous
civilization that has left only a few magnificent
monuments of its existence.</p>

<p>The sedan-chairs are put down before the
main entrance, which looks very much like that
of a suburban railway station, with its glass roof,
supported by iron posts. It is modern indeed.
It may be useful, but it is sadly commonplace.
There is a platform, too, not to miss anything
to complete the <i>tout ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>I am shown first into an ante-room which
might be that of any small country villa, and
our coats are hung on racks which have every
appearance of having come straight from Tottenham
Court Road. And then we step into a
drawing-room, which I prefer to call a waiting
room, an exact replica of those dreary places<span class="pagenum">[265]</span><a name="index265"></a>
where we are compelled to waste so many hours
of our lives. It might belong to a dentist, a
doctor, or a public official at home.</p>

<p>In the centre there is a huge table with the
kind of books which nobody ever dreams of
reading. The furniture is featureless, but not
altogether unpretentious, and the engravings
and pictures are of a sort that nobody cares for.
I was told by way of compliment to the West
that the Court arranged this apartment for
foreign receptions, and I wonder if it was entirely
without sarcasm or pardonable malice that
visitors are confronted with a room that makes
all the faults of modern Western taste so manifest.
It was a climax of all that is banal.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting we are entertained by His
Excellency the Master of Ceremonies, the
Lord Chamberlain, and several A.D.C.'s. They
all wear European uniforms, dark marine-blue
tunics, with many black and gold badges and
heavily braided dark red trousers. Everything
is of the best material and highly finished,
apparently made far beyond Korea's frontiers.
Some of the officials talk French, some English,
and all are most interesting and entertaining.
They have charming manners and all the natural
refinements of an ancient race.</p>

<p>Two of them are old acquaintances. I met
them years ago at Buckingham Palace, on the
occasion of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.<span class="pagenum">[266]</span><a name="index266"></a>
Prince Min is an accomplished man of the world.
He has just built a new house on the outskirts
of the city, "with all the most modern improvements,"
but I am rather sorry he has left his
old home, lost in the maze of the inner town
and buried in the shade of a few fine chestnut
trees. It was such a typical old Korean home,
looking outside like a hut built of mud and
covered with thatch, but inside looking like a
white paper box. Its tiny rooms were carpeted
with silky matting, and for furniture it had half
a dozen silk cushions&mdash;for ornamentation, but
a single flower stand.</p>

<p>There is a striking contrast between this
modern waiting-room and the old Korean house;
a contrast of vulgarity and refinement. I am
sorry to say I saw only a few of these quaint
old places, and I fear that on my next visit
they will all have disappeared. To pass the
time, tea, champagne-cup, and cigarettes, are
handed round, as they would be in any Western
house.</p>

<p>The New Palace and its diplomatic receptions
are managed by a Western lady.</p>

<p>There are some other Westerners holding
Court appointments here, some with the title of
teacher of languages, and many others under
different pretexts. But few of them render
services that are ever required.</p>

<p>The building of this New Palace is unquestionably<span class="pagenum">[267]</span><a name="index267"></a>
strange and antagonistic, but I will
confine myself to observing the material sides.
Its conception and architecture are equally incoherent;
it is such an unintelligible mixture
of old and new, national and foreign. Near the
hall, built exactly like an old yamen, there
stands a shed of corrugated iron, and a wonderful
old gate leads to a passage furnished with
Viennese chairs. The whole palace was built as
opportunity offered, without previous plans. It
came to be erected in the following way. During
the last revolution, the Empress lost her life: she
was dragged out of her room, atrociously tortured,
and stabbed by ruffians, or, as some say,
by foreign soldiers. Afterwards, her body was
burned in the adjoining deer park, at the foot
of the eastern hills. The Emperor himself
escaped only with the greatest difficulty, in a
disguise, carried on men's shoulders, as Anchises
was out of the burning ruins of Troy.
He never returned to those ill-fated walls,
but took refuge in the Russian Legation, and
remained there for a long time to be in greater
security.</p>

<p>After this, land was secured near the legations,
amidst the foreign settlement, and there the
New Palace was erected. It is not completed
yet, and I am afraid it will remain unfinished
for many years, and offer a source of income to
the commercial, trading, labouring, and idling<span class="pagenum">[268]</span><a name="index268"></a>
classes of the country.</p>

<p>At last His Majesty awoke from his siesta and
was ready to receive me. There are no ushers
and no Court functionaries, and little or no display.
The servants who came with the message
wore a red calico kaftan to the ground, with a
red calico hood that looked like a domino. It
is the Court livery, simple to make and cheap
to buy. Calico is the national material, that
everybody wears at all seasons of the year&mdash;in
winter padded with cotton-wool or sheepskin.
There are over 10,000,000 purchasers of calico
in Korea, and it has become quite an interesting
commercial question whether Japan's Osaka or
England's Manchester will secure the future
market.</p>

<p>By a little door and through a narrow passage,
built of white deal boards, we get to the inner
court, which is really a backyard surrounded
by store-rooms and servants' sheds.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_268.jpg" alt="The throne room" />
<p class="caption">THE THRONE ROOM<br />"Since the revolution, in which the Empress lost her life, the Emperor has never returned there"<br />
[To face page 268]</p></div>

<p>To avoid the mud it is necessary to use a
pathway composed of two planks. They are
narrow enough to test the skill of an equilibrist,
and it may be they are put down to drill the
courtiers in that useful art. On this occasion
these planks are covered with narrow bright
red carpet&mdash;a poor specimen of the thing usually
found in "furnished apartments," not at all
conducive to comfort, and apparently only a
harbour for the dust. The yard is deserted.<span class="pagenum">[269]</span><a name="index269"></a>
Here and there, out of peep-holes and half-open
doors, a few red-calicoed servants are gazing
with inquisitive eyes, but not one of them is in
attendance.</p>

<p>From the central building a wide, unpainted
door leads into the yard. The door is open and
we see a kind of hall, with its walls covered with
a large-patterned blue-and-white paper, which
probably lay for years neglected and unadmired
in some mean shop. There is a table in the
centre and a high screen behind. Squeezed in
between the two stands the Emperor. I can
hardly realize that I am in the presence of the
all-powerful potentate&mdash;an Emperor who is
more than ruler, and more even than despot,
in fact, an idol in the eyes of his people. His
person is sacred, his power is boundless, his
word is law, and he owns everything, land and
people, without restriction, his simple wish is
a command.</p>

<p>If human hand touches him it is sacrilege,
and the punishment for sacrilege is death. Even
the dead body of an emperor must be lifted
into the coffin by a special device. If the Emperor
touches a subject, the body so touched
becomes blessed. The Emperor's name must
not be mentioned except in whispers. His portrait
is never painted except after death, when
it becomes an object of worship in the ancestral
halls. Once a foreign envoy sought to<span class="pagenum">[270]</span><a name="index270"></a>
present the Emperor with the portrait of his
sovereign, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs
regarded the offer as an outrage and the portrait
was never accepted. How very strange
all these customs seem to be! But it is scarcely
thirty years since Korea was still, if not the
"Land of the Morning Calm," at least the
"Hermit Kingdom," secluded and unknown.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_270.jpg" alt="The Emperor of Korea" />
<p class="caption">THE EMPEROR OF KOREA<br /><i>Copyright, Nops Ltd.</i><br />
[To face page 270]</p></div>

<p>My impression of the Emperor is favourable.
His features are heavy, but the face is kind and
his expression is benevolent. Physically he is
delicate. I cannot imagine him to be a man of
strong likes or dislikes, and his shyness approaches
timidity. He wore ancient Korean
state robes of rich yellow hue, embroidered with
numberless cabalistic signs. Around his waist was
clasped a stiff ceremonial girdle, inlaid with jade.
It looked much like an iron hoop round a
shrunken barrel and seemed peculiar to Western
eyes, accustomed to belts that, on the contrary,
grip the body only too closely.</p>

<p>The representative of my country, who has
lived for many years in Korea, and is an excellent
scholar, had scarcely time to make the
necessary introductions before the Emperor
opened the conversation. He was most interested
in the way I had come, and hearing that
I had used the overland route, his questions were
inexhaustible. "When did you leave home?"</p>

<p>"How long have you been travelling?" "What<span class="pagenum">[271]</span><a name="index271"></a>
interested you most?" "What is the country
like?" "What do the people do?" "What
are their ambitions?" and so on. He seemed
to be interested in my own country, and especially
in all the different manners and customs
of the West.</p>

<p>"Is your country a very hilly one?" "Are
the people agricultural, as here?" "Is your
capital a very fine one, and what is the Emperor's
palace like? I hear there are magnificent Court
functions, and pageants with a great many
carriages. My envoys, coming home from the
European tour, gave me very interesting details
of your magnificent cities and great wealth, and
brought home many valuable souvenirs and
pictures. I am sorry to be too old, otherwise I
myself would start to see all I have heard about."</p>

<p>The state coaches seemed to appeal most to
his imagination, which, after all, is but natural,
considering that such a thing as a carriage has
never been known to the Koreans. His Majesty
even expressed a wish to order one in Europe.</p>

<p>Question after question came, giving me
scarcely time to give answers. I, of course,
could not ask questions except in an indirect
way, for in this respect Korea sticks firmly to
the etiquette of all Courts, which provides that
the monarch alone is allowed to start a new
topic of conversation.</p>

<p>"You must have been very glad on your<span class="pagenum">[272]</span><a name="index272"></a>
arrival at Seoul to find that the finest building
is your cathedral? What it must have been
to have built up such a high tower! and I am
told its interior is beautiful. Who was your
architect? How much did it cost?" I explained
that it was built by one of the fathers
who studied with great care the architectural
books of Viollet Le Duc, and that the expense
had been very limited, on account of nearly
everything being made on the spot.</p>

<p>But he was even more interested to hear
about our orphan schools close by, where nearly
two hundred children are saved from misery
and death. He was pleased to hear a little
more of what happens outside the palace gates,
to know something more about the charitable
work carried out in his own country.</p>

<p>It was astonishing to see with what keen
interest he followed my explanations.</p>

<p>He wanted to know my ideas concerning
Koreans, and especially Korean children and
the rising generation trained in our schools. I
was glad to have an opportunity of expressing
my satisfaction, and I told him how very much
surprised I was at seeing the Korean children at
work, and hearing their answers.</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe that boys out here
could be such good Latin scholars, some of them
far in advance of boys of the same age in European
schools. I was even more astonished to<span class="pagenum">[273]</span><a name="index273"></a>
see the real pleasure it gave them to study and
to improve. To me it shed quite a new light
on the Korean character and mind. What is
more satisfactory still is, that when these children
go back to their forlorn homes, as they do for
several months each year, they seldom fail to
return, and never forget what they have been
taught.</p>

<p>Next the Emperor sat the Crown Prince, a
man slightly over thirty years of age, overgrown
and heavy, apathetic, and lethargic in all
his movements. He shows little interest in anything
outside his own sphere, and scarcely any
capacity for the reception of new ideas. He is
married, but has no family.</p>

<p>But there is a younger brother who is in every
respect the reverse. He is bright, clever, active,
and instead of the heavy atmosphere of the
palace seeks the fresh air of far-away countries;
At present he is in the United States, working
hard, studying and gathering knowledge, experience,
and statesmanship, which may, as he
hopes it will, be of use to himself and to his
country.</p>

<p>Behind the Emperor and Crown Prince stands
a huge dark figure, casting a heavy black
shadow on them. His expression is stolid,
and he is mute, but he watches and follows
everything that goes on around us. He is the
chief eunuch of the palace, a man of great importance<span class="pagenum">[274]</span><a name="index274"></a>
and influence.</p>

<p>The chamberlains and princes accompany me
to my sedan-chair when I go. Before I leave
them they make an appointment for next day
to show me the ancestral hall and some of the
public buildings.</p>

<p>I must say they are all very courteous, and
want to show me much that they think would
prove useful to me. At last we start, sedan-chairs
begin to swing, hanging from eight bearers'
shoulders. A horseman rides ahead, while the
legation servants and the Kisos form a guard.
As we come to the large place before the palace
there is a dense crowd, a faction of the revolutionists
as I am told. The city is in great excitement.
As we pass along we meet crowds
everywhere.</p>

<p>Seoul is divided into two parties. One is
bitter against Russia and claims the delivery
and punishment of Y.-Yung-Yk, on whom all
the Imperial confidence and favours are bestowed
at this moment. Another party is in
favour of him and Russia. The former is for
Japan&mdash;but there is no party to support their
own country, to work for its independence, and
to secure its freedom. There seem to be very
few Koreans for Korea.</p>

<p class="center"><b>TOKIO</b></p>


<p>As the train stops at the terminus of Shimbashi,
I can scarcely realize that I have
reached the capital of beautiful Japan. The
huge station is one of the most commonplace
erections I have ever come across in my long
journeys. Platforms, booking offices, waiting
rooms, are perfect copies of all that the Western
mind has produced to be useful, but from
an artistic point of view featureless and
colourless. And even the crowd, which bustles
along and overflows the whole place, is as drab
as it could be in any commercial centre on our
side of the globe. Even those who still cling
to the national <i>kimono</i>, instead of keeping to the
old bright colours, have it made of dark cloth
or modern cotton material. As I step out into
the street my disappointment is even greater.
I see a few buildings constructed of wood, without
any ornamentation, the unpainted timber
grey and weather-beaten.</p>

<p>I must say the day is very much against the
creation of a favourable impression. It is a
cold January morning, gloomy and dark, sleet
falling from leaden clouds, and the streets are<span class="pagenum">[276]</span><a name="index276"></a>
thickly covered with black mud. I can almost
imagine myself in the suburbs of Pittsburg, for
there is a great deal of smoke, the only apparent
difference being that steel is replaced mostly by
timber. As my jinrickshaw rolls along through
the maze of wide streets and narrow lanes, I do
not feel elated. My extraordinary vehicle,
which is drawn by two men harnessed tandem
fashion and pushed by another, has, however,
an Eastern flavour, though the 'rickshaw was
actually invented by an Anglo-Saxon genius.</p>

<p>During the first weeks of my stay I visited all
the ancient monuments, temples, and pagodas,
and all the usual haunts of the traveller. There
are some fine specimens of Japanese art, though
they cannot be compared to the buildings of the
smaller cities. I come from Nara and Kyoto,
and this may be one of the reasons that everything
is so far below my expectations. Some
of the temples are certainly large, and one or
two pagodas quaintly designed, many of the
carvings being elaborate. But even the best
specimens can only be classed as decorative
art. Among them all, the most noteworthy
examples of Japanese architecture are the temples
dedicated to the memory of the Sh&#333;guns.
The decoration of the inner halls is sometimes
exquisite, the beams and friezes being beautifully
worked. Bronzes, finely cast, magnificently
finished, make the interiors delightful.<span class="pagenum">[277]</span><a name="index277"></a>
I specially admired the specimens of lacquer-work
I saw in the course of my rambles. Nearly
all the temples had panels, doors, chests, boxes,
utensils, and odds and ends of exceptional beauty.
It takes a long time for a Western eye to appreciate
fully the real qualities of good lacquer;
but when once it has been trained it will always
put their lacquer-work foremost among the
artistic productions of this people next to
bronzes, if not before them. The industry still
survives in full vigour, and I saw several specimens
which came very near those in the carefully
guarded collection of Nikko. I also saw
many fine bronzes, though their beauty is often
depreciated by the too-great elaborateness of
the design. Old national armour is to be found
in many of the temples and collections of the
capital, but, though most beautiful, it is not
yet in much demand in the bric-à-brac market.</p>

<p>But I have come to the conclusion that the
real charm of ancient Yeddo must have lain
more in nature than in art, in its bright suburbs,
evergreen groves, wistaria-covered arbours, and
chrysanthemum gardens; nature in her exuberance,
in her spring bloom, or the varied
tints of autumn intermingled with arched
bridges, carved balustrades, and flights of steps,
relieved by art. Monuments in Japan seem to
serve above all as a foreground to a fine view:
the most conspicuous towers, ex-voto lanterns,<span class="pagenum">[278]</span><a name="index278"></a>
or finest "tories," acquire an artistic value more
from their surroundings than from their intrinsic
worth. The way in which the monuments are
placed, the effect they give to the landscape,
and especially the view to be seen from them,
are the main points of interest. I am sorry that
books written on Japanese art generally fail to
perceive its real value, and point out merits it
does not possess. It is particularly the imagination
that ought to be dwelt on; not merely
the handiwork, but the conception of the brain.
Shrines, kiosks, pagodas, may sometimes be very
primitive, but in the imagination of the artist they
represented fairy buildings. It is the same with
their tiny little gardens, or dwarf woods. Though
they are in reality minute, they grow in the
owners' minds to veritable parks or virgin
forests. Some of the so-called Imperial palaces
around Nikko are most humble abodes, surrounded
by a little strip of land. Katsura-no-Rikyu
Palace, for instance, consists simply of
a few planks nailed together, forming a kind of
log house of one storey, a few feet square, and
divided in the interior by partitions or the so-called
sliding screens. Certainly it is no palace;
it can scarcely be called a house. It is literally
a shed roofed with bamboo and thatch,&mdash;nothing
more. And yet the followers of the
imaginative school of æsthetics saw it with
different eyes. To them it represented what<span class="pagenum">[279]</span><a name="index279"></a>
their fancy imagined, not what they saw in
reality, and the little open space before the
building, which, with the best will in the world,
can only be called a gravel yard, dotted with
unhewn stones, was to them the illimitable surface
of the ocean, the scattered blocks so many
islands and continents. In the corner stands
a little estrade of bamboo, where the Mikado
and his chosen friends used to sit in deep contemplation
before the elaborate world of their
fancy, and enjoy the passive happiness of the
Zen doctrine.</p>

<p>It would interest me to treat this subject
most explicitly, and to deal with Japanese art
from a psychological point of view; to consider
not merely the objects it has created, but rather
the mind and genius which have been manifested
in its different creations; to deal more at length
with the founders and pupils of the famous masters'
schools of Nara and Kyoto, and to explain where
their real value lies. To discuss the paintings,
statuary, and architecture, the refinement of
their watercolours, which can only be called
sketches, small bronzes and jade or stone figures,
the netsukes on masks, makimonos, "tories"
and pagodas, would afford to our matter-of-fact
appreciation an opportunity of realizing
more fully the strength of their imagination.
The average European generally admires in
Japanese work the finish of detail, elaborateness<span class="pagenum">[280]</span><a name="index280"></a>
of execution, and the patience of labour,
applied to its object. He pays high prices for
the workman's skill and manual dexterity, but
seems to be quite indifferent to the artist's idea
as such, and the originality of the conception
escapes him entirely.</p>

<p>Yet in the most famous creations of the
celebrated æsthetes we are more struck by the
force of their imagination than by the actual
work itself. The <i>cha-no-yu</i> style consisted, as
mentioned above with reference to the Katsura-no-Rikyu
Palace, of a few planks, bamboo
beams, and thatched roof, and Kobori Enshu,
Nippon's Le Notre, designed his gardens to
offer a panoramic effect more than a place of
recreation. It was not the house nor the grounds
in their real grandeur which effected the impression
desired; in fact, it was not reality at
all that was before them in its crude and sometimes
primitive material; but the suggestiveness
of log house and gravel yard, which developed
in their vivid fantasy into enchanted
palace and fairy land. Men retiring from active
life; generals crowned with many victories;
distinguished, even abdicating Mikados, secluded
themselves in different rural retreats
to enjoy, after the struggles of life, perfect
peace. They led a life of their own, an existence
not so much of active reality as of
passive contemplation, in which they discussed<span class="pagenum">[281]</span><a name="index281"></a>
different ideas and strove for new ideals. They
invented an artificial life of artistic refinement,
admiring for days together a single work of art
or a flower in full bloom, inhaling choice aromas
and smelling exquisite perfumes. And stately
processions were organized to go and partake
of afternoon tea in a summer-house, where every
movement was prescribed by strict etiquette,
and where the handing and receiving of the
cup were attended by fastidious courtesies, and
the making of the beverage of a special green
leaf, pounded to powder, and poured out of a
black earthen pot, was an occupation requiring
several hours. The tea ceremonies have often
been described; there is a whole literature at
our disposal, in which the regulations respecting
these proceedings are put down with the authority
of a code. But what is far more interesting
than the description of the elaborate
ceremonies is the problem of how the mind of
the people could have manifested itself in such a
complex and, to us, incomprehensible way. We
shall never fully realize how these men could have
sat on the <i>Tsuki-mi-dai</i>, the bamboo dais, for
hours, watching the moon rising behind the meadows,
gazing at the scene before them, lost in the
intricacy of their contemplation. And we shall
never understand their thoughts as we shall never
realize the world as seen from a Tsuki-mi-dai.</p>

<p>Is it astonishing if, in their imagination,<span class="pagenum">[282]</span><a name="index282"></a>
reality and fiction became "confusion worse
confounded," huts grew to palaces, the single
stones to islands, and, finally, they built up a
world of their own? As children gazing at
clouds give full play to their fancy, so did they
see in the external world what really existed
only in their inner consciousness. The explanation
of many of those vagaries lies in the
strength of their fantasy, the vividness of their
illusions; but we might go even further and
justly say that one of the strongest qualities of
the nation is the strength of their imagination.
With them fiction almost becomes reality, fancies
acquire positive values, and subjective sensations
are allowed to act upon the objective world.
Any one who is interested in metaphysical questions
will be struck by this trait, not only in
their art, but in every incident of their existence.
Whether in the past or present, it will strike us
as one of the main characteristics of the Japanese,
and, turning over the pages of their long
history, it is one of the prevailing features. It
was a potent factor, which gave strength to their
convictions and endurance to their arms. In
fact, their whole ancient moral code and their
laws of chivalry were based on the same principle.
The two qualities which inspire sincere
admiration all over the world&mdash;their great loyalty
to the sovereign and boundless patriotism&mdash;are
emanations of the same disposition. In fact<span class="pagenum">[283]</span><a name="index283"></a>
their greatest achievements were carried out
under the influence of some abstract conception
and brought to success by a national or ethical
ideal.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>If the artistic colouring of Tokio has faded
away for ever, its present aspect is marked by
the evidences of practical life, and if one's first
impression is one of general disappointment,
the second is one of deep interest. We soon
realize that the capital of Japan has ceased to
be a mere bazaar, full of glitter, where all the
toys and fancies of the East have been stored
to make a pleasant resort for the Western traveller.
It is a place of hard work, for the accomplishment
of serious aims.</p>

<p>Though my expectations in visiting the old
monuments were not fulfilled, and, as I said
before, from an antiquarian and artistic standpoint
the town failed to satisfy me, I became
daily more deeply interested in the busy life
and commercial enterprise of modern Nippon.
Workshops, manufactories, banks, insurance
offices, are increasing rapidly in number. The
electric and steam companies, railways and
shipping, telegraph and telephone companies,
have developed in a most astounding manner.<span class="pagenum">[284]</span><a name="index284"></a>
If we consider that the railway was only introduced
into the country in 1872, for the short
distance from Tokio to Yokohama, which was
followed by another short line in 1876 from
Kobe to Kyoto, and the first long line connecting
the two capitals was opened in 1890, it is
even more astonishing to see what has been
done in the succeeding ten years. To-day
railways have been laid all over the country,
and all the main cities are connected by direct
lines. To give an idea of this rapid development,
I may refer to the fact that in 1887 there
were 580 miles open for traffic, and in 1899 there
were 3421 miles. Besides the Government railways
a great many private companies have been
formed. About thirty years after the commencement
of Japan's new era, the Government
lines extended to 833 miles, including 60 miles
in Formosa, and the routes still under construction
1250. There were forty-four private companies
as well, with a capital of 228 million yen.
The rolling stock of the Government railways
amounted to about 1500 locomotives, 5000 cars,
and 18,000 goods wagons. Among private lines
the Nippon Tetsudo is the most important; it
is about 1000 miles long. The next in importance
are the Kiushiu and Sanyo railways.
To-day it is possible to go from the north end
of the country to the south, a distance of 1400
miles. The only interruption on the whole<span class="pagenum">[285]</span><a name="index285"></a>
track is the Straits of Moji, where there is still
a ferry, but this, it is said, will probably be replaced
by a steel bridge, such as that over the
Forth. The greater part of the rolling stock
is manufactured at home, only wheels and axles
being imported to any great extent from abroad.</p>

<p>The first telegraph line was installed in 1869
by English engineers. In 1877 all the foreign
employés had been replaced by natives, and ten
years later Japan joined the International Telegraph
Union. In 1891 the Government purchased
from the Great Northern Telegraph Company,
with great strategical foresight, and took
into its own hands, all the cables forming a direct
connexion with Korea. The telegraph offices
are not far off 2000 in number, and the length
of the wires is close on 30,000 kilometres. The
number of internal messages amounts to 16
millions, and of international messages to about
300,000. The longest main line is from Tokio
to Nagasaki&mdash;877 kilometres. There are several
thousands of employés, and in many places
bicycles are used for delivering the telegrams.</p>

<p>The telephone in Japan is more common than
in any other country in the world, except perhaps
Norway. Besides the Government and
public telephone offices, nearly every large commercial
house, and most private homes, have
telephones.</p>

<p>The establishment of the electric system of<span class="pagenum">[286]</span><a name="index286"></a>
illumination has become most popular in the
smallest villages, and forlorn hamlets are lighted
by electricity.</p>

<p>Steam navigation companies are numerous.
Besides local companies running small steamers
in the larger bays and inland seas, there are
several companies for international commerce.
Among all these companies the most important
is the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. It is the pride
of modern Japan, and I quite agree that there
are very few enterprises in the shipping line
which could surpass it in size and excellence of
organization. To quote from their annual report,
which will be of interest as giving an idea
of the success they have achieved: "With a
capital of 22 million yen, establishing regular
steamship services all over the world, and with
a fleet of 70 steamers aggregating 200,000 tons
gross, the majority of them new and provided
with every resource for contributing to the comfort
of passengers and every modern facility
for the carrying trade, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
now ranks among the greatest enterprises of the
kind in the world. The regular services maintained
by it, independently of its lines between
all the principal ports in Japan, are with China,
Asiatic Russia, the Straits Settlements, India,
the Red and Mediterranean Seas, Europe, Canada,
America, and Australia. The Japanese Diet in
1899 resolved to grant subsidies to the company's<span class="pagenum">[287]</span><a name="index287"></a>
European and American Lines, and thus
all foreign and home lines, with but a few exceptions,
have been ordered to run under the mail
contract of the Imperial Japanese Government.
The Head Office is in Tokio, and Branch Offices
and Agencies to the number of over seventy,
particulars of which are given elsewhere, are
situated at all the ports of call and other important
points. The total number of the Company's
employés is about 1200, in addition to
about 3500 of crews, firemen, etc."</p>

<p>This synopsis grows in interest, and is even
more surprising when we consider that the first
enterprise in steam navigation was started only
in 1868 between Osaka and Tokio, and in 1880
the Company possessed a fleet comprising about
fifty boats. Skippers, engineers, and all the chief
officers, were Westerners, and nearly all Englishmen.
But the Japanese proved to be apt pupils,
and every year a greater number of foreigners
were replaced by natives. To-day there are
only the captains and a few other officers on
the international lines who are still foreigners,
but even their days are numbered.</p>

<p>During my lengthened stay in the Far East,
I travelled a great deal on their lines, crossed the
Yellow Sea in several directions, went down
once to Shanghai and once to Hong Kong, made
an expedition to the Philippines and the neighbouring
islands, and, finally, made a journey<span class="pagenum">[288]</span><a name="index288"></a>
in one of their largest boats to Australasia; and
I can speak of them with high praise in every respect.
Of course, a great many of the boats are
built in England, with all the latest improvements.
They have electric light and ventilators.
And if people who are hard to please sometimes
find fault with the <i>chef's</i> department, I think
they are epicures who would make the same
objections on all other lines. But every one
unites in praising the general cleanliness on
board.</p>

<p>One of the suburbs of Tokio is almost entirely
devoted to shipbuilding, and on the strand of
the large inner bay there are numberless boats
in course of construction, though the most important
shipbuilding yards are in Nagasaki.
Tokio itself is the central point of all the most
important commercial enterprises. The national
and other banks, railway and shipping companies,
all have their headquarters here. Next
the modest, old-fashioned wooden houses, huge
palaces of brick and steel tower aloft, built
on the newest principles of American skyscrapers.
I must confess I don't admire them,
and I was sadly disappointed to find such
commonplace and up-to-date erections in the
Mikado's capital, where I expected to be delighted
with mysterious pagodas of a romantic
age.</p>

<p>Every day I passed several hours in these huge<span class="pagenum">[289]</span><a name="index289"></a>
blocks, and steadily became more and more
interested in Japan's commercial activity. In
fact, since the reorganization of the country
on Western principles the questions of education
and commerce are the most pressing of all the
problems with which they are confronted. Since
the establishment of the new era, which opened
their once secluded country to the outer world,
transformed their patriarchal system of government
into a parliamentary constitution, and reformed
the whole army and effected a complete
change in the juridical system, the national
economics and the education of the rising generation
are the riddles to be solved in the future.
All the commercial life gave me a great opportunity
of realizing the exceptional physical
capabilities, diligence, and capacity for hard
work, displayed by this people. The number
of hours of work an average man can do in the
fields or in the factories greatly exceeds that of
the Western races. And what is even more
striking is the great manual skill shown. The
dexterity of a Japanese artisan is too well known
to need description, but what I cannot omit
to mention is the rapidity with which they
execute their work; this faculty seems almost
instinctive or innate, and one glance at a model
is enough to enable the workman to reproduce
the object with absolute accuracy. Another
great advantage possessed by them is that the<span class="pagenum">[290]</span><a name="index290"></a>
necessaries of life are so restricted. The frugal
meals consist merely of a little rice or raw fish;
for luxury they have half a cup of <i>sakki</i> or
rice wine, and for recreation and pleasure an
afternoon walk in the flowering orchards or
cherry-groves. And if they have a superfluous
coin, they can go to the theatres, where national
epics are performed in the old-fashioned fascinating
style, and where a penny gives admittance
from morning to night. Their physical endurance
and freshness of mind are two qualities
which contribute to the great success they have
achieved. How long will they be able to preserve
them unspoilt? How long will they be
able to guard them from corruption? It is
evident that with a different manner of life they
are bound to undergo a change; with an increase
of daily needs, dissatisfaction is certain to grow.</p>

<p>Baron Ivasaki, one of Japan's principal financiers,
and the leader of many social enterprises,
after his return from a voyage of investigation
round the world, wrote a most interesting paper,
not only dealing with his personal experiences
but pointing out possibilities, both of financial
and moral crises that might occur if the country
did not unite to promote, not only commercial
and financial endeavour, but a high moral tone.
All good patriots and friends of Japan agree with
the author in this respect. Unquestionably,
there is always a great danger when a nation's<span class="pagenum">[291]</span><a name="index291"></a>
ideals become merely material. It is even more
disastrous if its spiritual life threatens to become
extinct. One of the causes of Japan's strength
has been her firm belief in her religious, national,
and domestic codes. The great rapidity with
which she has adopted Western civilization
might easily have resulted in her acceptance,
not only of our good points, but also of our bad
ones. Considering her marvellous gift of adaptation,
the question arises whether this does not
happen sometimes, to the detriment of better
judgment. In her great zeal to advance and
to use all Western means, some of her deeper
thinkers begin to realize the dangers which
might beset her. The rapid transformation of
the old social order must develop by gradation
to avoid fresh revolutions, and to spread over
the whole country. It is not enough for her
to accept merely the technical side of Western
civilization, she must understand and be fully
convinced by its moral and spiritual principles.
The nations of Europe may belong to different
denominations, but their mind and soul are
imbued by the higher laws of Christianity.
Baron Ivasaki, in his articles, points out with
great foresight that it is not enough for his
countrymen's future greatness and happiness
to improve materially, if there is not a corresponding
moral elevation.</p>

<p>It becomes evident that the most important<span class="pagenum">[292]</span><a name="index292"></a>
question of the day is that of education.
During my prolonged stay in the
capital I visited a great many schools and
colleges. Besides the well-equipped Government
Primary Schools I saw many Grammar
and High Schools, Public and Private Colleges,
and Missionary Establishments. Public instruction,
as a rule, is very satisfactory. The teaching
of foreign languages, and especially of technical
knowledge, is quite surprising, and the
examinations in these subjects have the best
results. Education, as such, is less successfully
carried out; the chief defect of our Western
system of devoting itself exclusively to the imparting
of knowledge, to the detriment of the
formation of character and the arming of the
child for the battle of life, more from a moral
than from a material standpoint, is also the
drawback of this country. Among Tokio's
scholastic foundations the University is the
most important. To give an epitome of its
history:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_292.jpg" alt="The State examination hall" />
<p class="caption">THE STATE EXAMINATION HALL AT PEKIN<br />"The students are secluded for several days in the small cells, while the professors watch from the tower"<br />
[To face page 292]</p></div>

<p>"The germ of this institution was the <i>Bansho
Shirabejo</i>, or 'Place for the Examination of
Barbarian Writings,' founded by the Tokugawa
Government in 1856. Seven years later, this
name was altered to that of <i>Kaisei-jo</i>, or, 'Place
for Developing and Completing,' which indicated
a change for the better in the views held by the
Japanese as to the value of European learning.<span class="pagenum">[293]</span><a name="index293"></a>
Numerous other modifications have taken place,
both in the name and scope of the institution,
which since 1881 has been placed on a thoroughly
modern footing, and now includes colleges of
Law, Medicine, Engineering, Literature, Science
and Agriculture, where lectures are delivered by
a large staff of professors of various nationalities
and in various languages. The students number
over 2700. The courses that attract most
students are those of Law, Medicine, and Engineering.
A large hospital connected with the
University stands in the same grounds. Other
institutions under the authority of the President
of the University are the Botanical Gardens
in the district of Koishikawa, and the Tokio
Observatory at Ligura."</p>

<p>It is a large establishment, covering a huge
area of park-like ground, dotted with long red
brick piles. Different faculties occupy separate
buildings, and if not picturesque, they are well
adapted to their function. The library is
especially fine, very well equipped, and cleverly
organized. It interested me to observe that
whenever I came the large reading-room was
always filled with students, and it afforded a
good opportunity of watching the keenness with
which they pursue their studies. I made acquaintance
with several of the leading professors,
some of whom are Western. They all assisted
me very kindly in my investigations. The<span class="pagenum">[294]</span><a name="index294"></a>
statements of Professor von Koerber, who is
the teacher of the history of modern philosophy,
were of especial value. To judge the mental
capacity of the rising generation, it is essential
to see how metaphysical questions appeal to
them, and, as I perceived, they were more prone
to accept theories which appealed to their great
imaginative qualities than to draw abstract conclusions
by the medium of purely logical deductions.
They prefer Schopenhauer to Kant,
Plato to Aristotle, and so it will be easy to comprehend
the unquestionable influence which the
modern evolutionist school exerts over the mind
of young Japan.</p>

<p>Another institution of great importance is
the Government Printing Office, the so-called
<i>Insatsu Kyoku</i>, its scope including much besides
printing, the paper currency of the country
being manufactured here too. The offices are
marvellously equipped, but the skill of the workmen
is even more marvellous. The reproduction
of different old prints, etchings, and watercolours
by mechanical means, is a triumph of
art, and the <i>editions de luxe</i> of the old Japanese
masters are unique in their way. As I said
before, manual skill and the faculty of copying
are national gifts, and, during my repeated visits
to workshops, factories, and builders' yards, it
was these characteristics which most impressed
me. I returned frequently to the new Commercial<span class="pagenum">[295]</span><a name="index295"></a>
Museum, where there is such a good
opportunity given to judge what Japan's commercial
production will be in the future. There
are already several branches in which they run
us very close, if they don't surpass us. In the
production of cheap articles they are certainly
already ahead, and common calico and cotton
goods have not only replaced the European
supply for the requirements of the country, but
they almost monopolize the market of Korea,
and export a great deal to China and Eastern
Asia. Cheap china is manufactured to a great
extent also, and so are cloth, felt, and leather
goods of all kinds. In the Museum there are
specimens of the different home industries, and
if the quality leaves something to be desired,
and does not promise to be very durable, the
prices are so low that the customer can afford
to purchase, as all Orientals like to do, something
new constantly. Unquestionably within a very
short time Tokio's and Osaka's large firms will
be the great competitors of Birmingham and
Manchester, and the European trade in the
East will be mostly secured by Japan.</p>

<p>In speaking of Tokio's noteworthy establishments,
I finish, where I might have begun, with
the Arsenal, where the famous <i>San-ju-nen Shiki</i>,
Japan's victorious weapon, is manufactured.
Arms, guns, soldiering and fights are out of my
sphere, but I could not help observing the up-to-date<span class="pagenum">[296]</span><a name="index296"></a>
character of Tokio's military equipment.
Not only do the barracks bear witness to perfect
order and cleanliness, but the military schools
and training establishments are well organized
and demand hard work in every respect. Soldiers
and officers impress us equally by their
neatness and perfect turn-out and their spirit of
discipline; and still more impressive are the
extraordinary vivacity and unceasing activity
which they display. Their endurance and
capacity for work are, I think, unsurpassed by
any other army.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_296.jpg" alt="Shrines at Nikko" />
<p class="caption">SHRINES AT NIKKO<br />"To conjure up the past or to recall bygone traditions, one ought to linger in Nara's sacred groves and
Nikko's hidden shrines"<br />
[To face page 296]</p></div>

<p>Finally, if I were asked to enumerate the interesting
sights of Tokio, or to give advice what to
see, and especially how to see Tokio, I should
to a certain extent deviate from the generally
adopted plans of the guide-books. Instead of
drawing attention to the past, I would deal
more with the present; instead of describing
the monuments of bygone ages only, I would
point out the modern institutions of the capital;
instead of dreaming in the old cemeteries of the
Shoguns and Ronins, I would awaken some
interest in schools, factories, and barracks. In
fact, instead of dwelling on what is dead, I
would study what is to be born and what is
already alive. And so the first disappointment
of missing the expected gay fairyland will turn
into interest in serious reality. Thus travellers
would derive greater benefit and waste less<span class="pagenum">[297]</span><a name="index297"></a>
time, if they were prepared at the outset for
Tokio, not as it may once have been and as we
still imagine it from description, but as it has
developed in the last quarter of a century. To
conjure up the past or to recall bygone traditions,
one ought to linger in Nara's sacred groves
and Nikko's hidden shrines; but on arrival in
Tokio and Osaka, one is awakened to the reality
of modern times, and dreams are bound to give
place to the hard work of life. After the first
disappointment caused by the capital's inartistic
and rather incoherent aspect of today,
one cannot fail to be impressed by the activity
of its inhabitants; and the repugnance roused
by its prosaic outlook, where new and old mingle
indiscriminately, once overcome, one begins to
understand and appreciate the indefatigable
labour by which all this change has been
achieved.</p>

<p>I would advise my friends, if they can do so,
to choose a favourable season for visiting Tokio.
If possible, they should arrive in the middle of
the spring, when the magnificent forests and
shady groves are in foliage, when the orchards
are in bloom, and the flower-gardens most
luxuriant; or in the autumn, when the leaves
begin to turn, when the maples glow like fires
on the hillsides, and the sea-breeze scatters the
yellow leaves of the birch in golden showers.
To stay there during the months when the<span class="pagenum">[298]</span><a name="index298"></a>
beauty of nature is at its zenith, and by its
marvellous harmony of colour and outline,
which is, after all, Japan's main beauty, makes
one forget what time has destroyed and civilization
ruined, and recompenses one for many
charms vanished for ever. At this time of the
year the different suburbs offer delightful retreats
for the traveller's leisure hours. And
some of the old monuments, even though
they be not works of art of great value, yet,
surrounded as they are by rich vegetation,
present a perfect <i>tout ensemble</i>. To those who
have the privilege of entering the Mikado's
palace, and perchance obtain an invitation to
the celebrated Imperial chrysanthemum festival,
the beauty of the grounds at this season
will compensate for the modesty of the buildings
and the simplicity of the interior; and though
the brilliant hues of the courtiers' embroidered
kimonos are replaced by black frock-coats, the
chrysanthemums are still gorgeous and dazzling.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_298.jpg" alt="Delightful scenery" />
<p class="caption">DELIGHTFUL SCENERY<br />"When the magnificent forests and shady groves are in foliage"<br />
[To face page 298]</p></div>

<p>I can't help repeating with emphasis my
advice to take interest in life's more serious
factors. As soon as possible after arrival, observe
and study, whenever there is a chance, the daily
routine of one of the most advancing young
countries which unfolds before the visitor. Do
not restrict your visits merely to sights; besides
museums inspect some schools, and instead of


hunting up pagodas of little artistic value, see<span class="pagenum">[299]</span><a name="index299"></a>
some of the workshops. In particular, look
carefully at the work, as such, and form your
conclusions from your personal experience. And
I would counsel the getting of introductions to
managers of large firms, to the directors of railway
and shipping companies; in fact, to all the
leaders of Tokio's various social movements.
Call on the different ministries, and do not omit
to make the acquaintance of the chiefs of the
numerous political parties, whom you will find
marvellously well informed on political matters,
and generally very interesting. And witness some
of the sittings of Parliament and a few public
assemblies and meetings of shareholders. In
short, my last word of advice would be, do not
go with the idea of idling, but of studying, in
Tokio; and in this case you may not think it
pretty, but unquestionably you will realize that
it is one of the most interesting cities in the
whole wide world.</p>

<p>If Japan has proved herself a very clever
scholar of the West, the West on its side can
learn a great deal today from Japan. In this
respect we could not find a better object-lesson
than the Imperial capital, Tokio.</p>

<p class="center "><b>THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS OF JAPAN

<p>It is snowing. The white flakes fall persistently,
and are driven round and round in
whirlwinds. Looking out of my window the
landscape is cold and dreary. The large square
roofs of the houses and the trees are covered with
a heavy white mantle.</p>

<p>In no direction can a single soul be seen. It
is as if the whole town and the inhabitants had
gone into their winter sleep; all is silent and
dead under Nature's immaculate pall. I can
scarcely believe that I am in the Land of the
Rising Sun; it is so difficult to realize that this
snowed-in city is the capital of Japan, as colour
and glitter form the two main features in our
primary conception of Nippon's Island.</p>

<p>We expect to see the brilliant shades of the
bright pictures and rich embroideries and heavy
silks of Japan even more brilliant under the
beams of this Eastern sun, as it is represented
on the national flag.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_300.jpg" alt="Street in Japan" />
<p class="caption">STREET IN JAPAN<br />"I never saw more poles and beams and masts of different height piercing the sky"<br />
[To face page 300]</p></div>

<p>The European hopes to find Japan above all
an Asiatic, even an exotic country. He wants
something like the bazaars of Cairo or Ceylon's<span class="pagenum">[301]</span><a name="index301"></a>
palm-groves, tropical like the wildernesses of
Java, and ever-blooming like Burmah's gardens.
Arriving at Tokio, disappointment in this respect
is general, for Tokio is neither bright nor
artistic. In fact, the capital of Japan is one of
the most colourless and prosaic places on the
globe.</p>

<p>Its buildings are nearly all of logs of wood&mdash;planks
nailed to each other&mdash;without any
external ornamentation; to commend their
style or taste is impossible, for most of the houses
have not even an attractive appearance. The
old pagodas and the historic temples make an
exception to the general rule, but their number
is limited, and they are hidden by the groves of
centuries.</p>

<p>The general impression of the town is monotonous,
and what makes it even more so is that
the houses are, as a rule, only one storey high,
and the unpainted wood they are constructed
of assumes in time a weather-beaten hue; in
fact, the outline is only broken by an innumerable
number of telegraph-poles. I never saw
more poles and beams and masts of different
height piercing the sky.</p>

<p>I was rather sorry to have such a cold morning
for the day of the audience graciously accorded
to me by the Emperor. I must confess that
I should have preferred a warm, bright day in
the late spring, when everything is in blossom,<span class="pagenum">[302]</span><a name="index302"></a>
every corner full of flowers, and Japan looks
more as it is pictured on its rich screens and
artistic fans.</p>

<p>It is still quite early when the large, heavy
barouche belonging to our legation comes to
fetch me, and the two strong, well-bred, native
horses have hard work to get through the snow-covered
streets. Our way is uninteresting; the
thoroughfares are too wide altogether, and the
small houses on both sides are dwarfed and
insignificant.</p>

<p>But we also pass some large modern buildings,
American brick-and-steel erections. These are
public offices and banks, and make a rather unpleasant
contrast in the calm scenery. For some
time we skirt a large canal partly frozen over;
this forms the outer moat of the Imperial castle.</p>

<p>We stop before a large gate. It is opened at
once, and a detachment of small but well-set-up
Japanese soldiers present arms. Next comes
a bridge, a new stone construction, ornamented
with huge candelabra, without much architectural
beauty, and without any Japanese flavour.
But it leads to a magnificent avenue of cryptomerea,
each tree a giant, and all of them of
venerable age, their trunks covered with dark
moss, and their foliage forming an emerald arch&mdash;emerald
set in crystals, for their branches
are heavily laden with frost.</p>

<p>The avenue looks like a corner of the famous<span class="pagenum">[303]</span><a name="index303"></a>
Tokaïdo highway, the Japanese main artery
for centuries, where the whole country wandered&mdash;rich
and poor, mighty and humble, from Kioto
to Tokio, from the Mikado's to the Shogun's
Court, the Daimios with their retinues in gold
and silver; where, too, all the warriors rode in
their rich armour, and all the troops marched
to war, or home to rest; where all the pilgrims
walked to the famous shrines of Nara and Nikko.</p>

<p>This avenue, leading to the palace, affords
compensation for all the inartistic streets outside
the walls. I am even glad that it is covered
with snow, and that its sole inhabitants are a
few gardeners shovelling the ice aside. The
dark trees and the white snow, and these few
men clad in straw capes looking very much like
the back of a porcupine, and wearing hats like
flat tea-trays, are so original and so typical.
At last I have a real Japanese picture before
me, and not one of those we get at home highly
coloured and made partly for the cheap Western
markets, but a picture full of harmony in an
artistic setting, like one of those famous Kakomenos
in black and white by the most celebrated
disciples of the great Kano school.</p>

<p>A sharp turn brings us to an open space, and
the palace is in front of us.</p>

<p>I am afraid "palace" is not the right expression,
as it looks from the outside like a large Indian
bungalow. It is only one storey high, mainly<span class="pagenum">[304]</span><a name="index304"></a>
constructed of wood and beams, scarcely ornamental,
and covered with a sloping roof of indifferent
tiles. There is nothing striking about
it, nothing that would attract attention, nothing
that is at all imposing; it looks comfortable and
nothing more.</p>

<p>The carriage stops before a flight of steps
leading to a simple but spacious ante-room.
There is a large table on which are the Imperial
visiting-books, a few chairs; round the room
stand some servants, dressed in ordinary French
livery. I am shown through a long corridor,
which is Japanese in character. It has no furniture
at all; the beams are carved, and if not imposing
are perfect in detail. The large drawing-room,
where we sit down, is entirely modern.</p>

<p>The furniture is such as you would see anywhere
in Europe, and specially in America&mdash;rich,
but without any special style or individuality,
the only exceptions being a fine cabinet
of priceless old lacquer ware, and a large golden
screen ornamented with an enormous dragon
and signed "Kano Montonabu."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_304.jpg" alt="The Tokaïdo" />
<p class="caption">THE TOKAÏDO<br />"The avenue looks like a corner of the famous Tokaïdo highway"<br />
[To face page 304]</p></div>

<p>I was rather sorry that the decorations of the
whole room did not adhere to the national taste.
I should have liked to banish every gilded
bracket and velvet lounge, and restore it to its
original simplicity&mdash;such simplicity as is to be
found in the Katsura Palace at Kioto.</p>

<p>The Emperor is a late riser, and until he is<span class="pagenum">[305]</span><a name="index305"></a>
ready Baron S&mdash;&mdash;a keeps me company. He
speaks perfect English, having studied in England
for many years; and, even more, he married
an English lady whose house has become
the meeting-place of all Western and local
celebrities.</p>

<p>It is a charming villa, looking very much
like an English cottage, and overlooking one of
the prettiest corners of the Bay of Tokio; full
of English books and Japanese art treasures&mdash;English
comfort and Japanese taste&mdash;it is
one of those homes that one remembers with
pleasure, and looks forward to seeing again.</p>

<p>The Baron is certainly a most accomplished
Master of Ceremonies; he has all the gentleness
of old Japanese manners, and all the culture of
Japanese civility, and performs his somewhat
tedious duties as if they gave him a personal
pleasure.</p>

<p>There are several other gentlemen in attendance&mdash;the
Lord Chamberlain, also a few A.D.C.'s
and chamberlains-in-waiting. They are all wearing
Court dresses of dark blue, or of red with
gold lace.</p>

<p>His Majesty receives me in his private apartment,
whither I am escorted through endless
passages. The nearer we get, the colder is the
temperature. All the reception-rooms are heated
with water-pipes to suit Western taste, but in
the Imperial rooms there are only old-fashioned<span class="pagenum">[306]</span><a name="index306"></a>
braziers. The reception-room is small, typically
Japanese, has no windows, but only sliding
screens, and is denuded of all furniture. The
Mikado is standing in the centre, and for the
occasion is wearing the uniform of a general of
his army, consisting of a dark blue tunic, and
even darker red trousers; and as a kind attention
he wears the diamond-set star of St. Stephen,
first King of Hungary. He is surrounded by
his staff and several A.D.C.'s, and throughout,
the formalities are carried out with perfect
Court ceremonial.</p>

<p>His Majesty shakes hands in a military fashion
and at once puts me at my ease by asking questions.
First, he wants to hear about my country
and our venerable monarch.</p>

<p>"When did you leave home?" "How is
His Majesty, your benevolent sovereign?"
"By what route did you come out?" "Did
you find the Siberian line comfortable?"
"Prince Katsura came from King Edward's
Coronation by the same line, and enjoyed his
journey very much. Your journey through
this region which is so little known must have
interested you." "How long did the last part
of your journey through Manchuria take, and
what were your experiences like in Korea?"
"It must be most interesting coming from
Europe to see such entirely different countries
and people." "I hope your experiences have<span class="pagenum">[307]</span><a name="index307"></a>
been satisfactory." "I wish you to see as much
in Japan as you think would be of interest to
you. As you may observe, we are working very
hard, and we try to adopt in many respects the
main features of Western civilization and ideas.
I am glad to hear you are interested in education.
I dare say you liked our University library and
the new printing establishments; you ought
to see some of the provincial towns, too, and the
commercial activity carried on in some of them.
Don't omit to see Osaka; I am going myself
next month, so I hope I may meet you there
again."</p>

<p>Commercial and economic questions evidently
interested His Majesty, who was taking a very
active part in the arrangements for the Exhibition
at Osaka, which was about to be opened.
And he spoke about many other questions regarding
the country and its development.</p>

<p>The Emperor detained me for an unusual
length of time, and seemed to be interested in
all the different matters that formed the subject
of our conversation. It must be rather difficult
for a sovereign who is brought up from birth
within these palace walls to realize the outer
world, and it must be even more so to get an
insight into human nature, meeting it only at
official receptions.</p>

<p>Before I left a message came from Her Majesty
the Empress, expressing a wish to receive me<span class="pagenum">[308]</span><a name="index308"></a>
too. Her apartments are in an adjoining wing.
Her boudoir is ornamented in the French style,
and her windows overlook a small Japanese
garden. Her dress was of Western fashion too,
rather elaborate for that early hour of the day,
but in good taste. Her two ladies-in-waiting
were clad in the same fashion.</p>

<p>At the first glance I understood the Empress's
great popularity. Her gentleness and kind
heart are visible in her glance in an exceptional
way. There is something very small and fragile
about her. She looks rather delicate, and her
pale features wear an expression of sadness
which cannot fail to impress. She seems, besides
being kindly disposed and benevolent by
nature, to have had sorrows like most other
human beings, and this feature, shared in common
by owners of palaces and of hovels, makes
her very human, and very sympathetic. She
has led, in her vast palace and high position, a
rather solitary life, and solitude gives time for
thought, and to ponder deeply on the problems
of our destinies. Nobody could better understand
this spirit of abnegation for the sake of a
higher ideal than Her Majesty. Indeed woman's
devotion of herself to the good of her family has
always been as much praised in Japan as man's
loyalty to his country. The paramount qualities
of the female side of this nation are not yet
known by the world at large, and are very often<span class="pagenum">[309]</span><a name="index309"></a>
misjudged by those who have passed through
Nippon's island. But all those who have stayed
for some length of time, especially the members
of the Missions, speak with great respect of their
qualities and virtues, and particularly of the
marvellous sense of duty and spirit of self-sacrifice
of the daughters for their parents, of
the wives for their husbands, and of the mothers
for their sons.</p>

<p>Our conversation was mainly about abstract
questions, family life, education, charitable
works, hospitals, orphanages, and homes. She
is patroness of the Red Cross Society of Japan,
and listened with great interest to my account
of the work carried on by the Sisters of Charity,
and in the different institutions under the Archbishop's
care. Her sympathy can do a great
deal, and I hope she will use it in favour of this
great work, carried out with such apostolic zeal
for the benefit of the sick and forlorn orphans,
to save the children's lives, and to nurse the
lepers and the incurables, whatever the cost
and sacrifice.</p>

<p>She went into all kinds of details, and asked
hundreds of questions about these poor little
mites, and exhibited that interest which only
a woman can when she is talking about children.
It seemed to appeal to her heart, and she repeatedly
expressed her gladness at having had
the opportunity of hearing about the good work<span class="pagenum">[310]</span><a name="index310"></a>
carried on by our church.</p>

<p>I left the room full of the hope that her noble
kindness might prove to be a support to this
little fraction of her needful subjects.</p>

<p>As a special favour, I was shown over all the
different apartments. We went through the
state rooms and inner apartments, walked
through endless corridors, and viewed the
numerous art treasures. There is an extraordinary
mixture in taste of West and East, but
there is no doubt that the supremacy belongs
to the latter, for what is Japanese is really fine.</p>

<p>All the long dadoes are carved elaborately and
of exquisite workmanship, and the fretted ceilings
are charming in design and colouring. They
are as a rule of dark beams, framing gilt grounds;
the carving and bronze casts are finely executed.</p>

<p>We finished our wanderings in a delightful
little garden, which is Japanese indeed in the
highest degree. There is a tiny pond, no larger
than a good-sized basin, surrounded by a rockery
imitating Fuji; and across an almost imaginary
stream a few inches wide is thrown a wooden
bridge. Everything is minute: even the little
rustic summer-house is no larger than that of a
doll. It is a Lilliputian world of its own. Even
the trees are dwarfs; but the Japanese imagination
makes everything large.</p>

<p>If any one is interested in the Japanese mind
and its imaginative qualities, the best fields of<span class="pagenum">[311]</span><a name="index311"></a>
study are some of these famous gardens laid out
by the great æsthetes of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries; men of undoubted refinement
and culture, some being statesmen retired
from the excitement of political life, and many
Mikados seeking rest in solitude, after the glitter
and pomp of the Court.</p>

<p>Their gardens simply consisted of a few
square yards of ground, surrounded by a plain
bamboo hedge, a log house built of a few planks,
and consisting of two rooms, with gravel scattered
before the doorways, and a few tiny bushes
growing round. Small and simple, I dare say
primitive to European eyes, but to a Japanese
mind these shrubs represent a virgin forest, the
log house is a palace, the gravel court unlimited
sea, and the stepping-stones so many islands.</p>

<p>With their love of artistic refinement and
elaborate civilization, they look through the
shades of broken prisms, and scent perfumes
of different compositions, and build up a whole
imaginary world of dainty colours and exquisite
odours. But who, coming from the West, would
ever understand any of these details of an
historical past and ancient customs and strange
manifestations of national culture?</p>

<p>And who, returning from one of these gardens,
so full of reminiscences of old Japan, to the
modern streets, would understand how the new
towns are being built up of brick and steel, and<span class="pagenum">[312]</span><a name="index312"></a>
how the whole nation is changed by hard work
and boundless energy?</p>

<p>And above all, who can at this moment explain
or understand all the progress of modern
Japan and fully realize all its future importance?</p>

<p class="center "><b>JAPAN AND CHINA ON THE THRESHOLD
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</b></p>


<p class="center ">I<br/>
JAPAN</p>

<p>The question of the Yellow Peril has once
again come to the front through the recent
East-Asiatic war. The unprecedented success
of Japan, both by land and sea, has roused
universal surprise. When the first news of
victories gained by the small insular power
reached Western Europe, they were received
with genuine joy; but as the Japanese advanced
on the mainland of Asia, symptoms of anxiety
began to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>What would happen if they conquered all
Eastern Asia, and perhaps Siberia also? Above
all, what would happen if Japan, united with
China, were to overrun the Russian dominions,
and one day threaten Central Europe? Already
here and there the sad recollection of
the old Tartar campaigns was being revived;
and indeed, why should not a modern, ambitious
commander follow in the wake of his
famous predecessor, Genghis Khan? A modern<span class="pagenum">[314]</span><a name="index314"></a>
military genius, a Yellow Napoleon, enjoying
equal popularity and possessing the same magic
power, with millions of money and countless
troops at his disposal, might surely become a
very serious and formidable antagonist. But
would it be to the interest of the yellow race to
overrun Europe? This problem is yet awaiting
its solution.</p>

<p>I venture to think that under the present
conditions the majority of the Eastern people
have no intention or desire to enlarge their
territory beyond its original borders. If they
can only get back what is nominally theirs&mdash;what,
not more than half a century ago, was possessed
by them&mdash;they will be satisfied. Japan,
which is decidedly overpopulated, and cannot
adequately provide for its nearly fifty millions
of inhabitants, dispersed over the various islands,
may possibly have an eye on some of the neighbouring
Asiatic coastlands, but for colonizing
purposes is more likely to turn its attention
towards the South Sea. And since the ambition
of Japan has been awakened, and its adaptabilities
to modern culture, its unflagging energy,
and its admirable military skill, been developed,
there is more possibility that in a remote future
Nippon might make Australasia the Utopia of its
colonizing efforts.</p>

<p>Certain it is that a brilliant future awaits
Japan. The land is rich, and its position,<span class="pagenum">[315]</span><a name="index315"></a>
between Eastern Asia and Western America,
most advantageous, both from an economic
and from a strategic point of view. The people
are healthy, strong, industrious, and possess
in an extraordinary degree the faculty of assimilation.
In this respect, indeed, Japan is unrivalled
by any other race.</p>

<p>The primary cause of their present marvellous
success must unquestionably be sought in this
faculty of assimilation and in the power of
discipline&mdash;in the wonderful ease wherewith
they appropriate all the acquisitions of the
West&mdash;the way in which they carry them
out. The second cause of their success is
their old military system of government, which
has produced the present-day soldiers. But in
order to grasp thoroughly the situation it is
necessary to cast a cursory glance on the past
history of Japan. In doing so we should remember
in the first place that ancient Nippon
was built upon the system of vassalage. The
land was divided into principalities of various
sizes, at the head of each of which was a <i>Daimio</i>,
or vassal chieftain, just as the empires of the
West were formerly protected and ruled over
by baronial chiefs. Feudalism in Europe led
to perpetual frontier quarrels and wars, and
this was the case also in Japan. The Daimios
were always at enmity with one another, and
their government was a period of petty<span class="pagenum">[316]</span><a name="index316"></a>
warfare.</p>

<p>The military element, therefore, naturally
occupied a prominent position, and just as in
Europe the knight became the founder of
<i>Chivalry</i>, so in Japan the <i>Samurais</i> established
the <i>Bushido</i>. And as the German knight of
Chivalry created a legal system called <i>Club-law</i>,
for the protection of his own interests,
so the soldiers of Japan had their own military
code. The military thus became the privileged
class of society. This caste, with its rigorous
rules and external organization, had a perfectly
developed existence, a special moral standard,
and to a certain extent a religion of its own.
As the age of Chivalry was created by the
knights of old, so "Bushido," the ethics of the
Samurais, originated in the Land of the Rising
Sun.</p>

<p>To give an exact definition of the word
"Bushido" is impossible, because the conception
of it is unknown to us. There are no analogous
circumstances necessitating its existence
with us. The idea of chivalry is the nearest
approach to an interpretation of the word,
although literally "Bushido" means "Military
manner"&mdash;the manner and the way in which it
is the duty of the armed nobility to fight, to
live, and to die. We notice that according to
this definition the word includes more than a
mere title; it expresses a whole social system,<span class="pagenum">[317]</span><a name="index317"></a>
and regulates the views and appreciations of
life of all its members.</p>

<p>The description given by Dr. Nitobe enables
us to form some idea of Bushido from a Japanese
standpoint. "Bushido is the code of moral
principles which the knights were required or
instructed to observe. It is not a written code;
at best it consists of a few maxims handed down
by oral tradition or coming from the pen of
some well-known warrior or savant. More
frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten,
but impressed on the fleshy tablets of the heart.
It was founded, not on the creation of one
brain, however able, or on the life of a single
personage, however renowned. It was an organic
growth of decades and centuries of military
career. It perhaps fills the same position in
the history of ethics that the English Constitution
does in political history; yet it has nothing
to compare with the Magna Carta or the Habeas
Corpus Act. It is true that early in the seventeenth
century Military Statutes (Buké Hatto)
were promulgated, but their thirteen short
articles were taken up mostly with marriages,
castles, leagues, etc., and didactic regulations
were but meagrely touched upon. We cannot,
therefore, point out any definite time and place,
and say, Here is its fountain-head. It is not
till the feudal age that it attains consciousness.
Its origin, in respect to time, may be identified<span class="pagenum">[318]</span><a name="index318"></a>
with feudalism. But feudalism itself is woven
of many threads, and Bushido shares its intricate
nature. As in England the political institution
of feudalism may be said to date from the
Norman Conquest, so we may say that in
Japan its rise was simultaneous with the ascendancy
of Toritomo late in the twelfth century.
As, however, in England we find the social elements
of feudalism far back in the period previous
to William the Conqueror, so, too, the
germs of feudalism in Japan have been long
existent before.</p>

<p>"Again, in Japan as in Europe, when feudalism
was formally inaugurated, the professional class
of warriors naturally came into prominence.
These were known as samurai, meaning literally,
like the old English cniht (knecht, knight),
guards or attendants, resembling in character
the soldurii, whom Caesar mentioned as existing
in Aquitania. A Sinico-Japanese class,
named Bu-Ké or Bu-Shi (fighting knights), was
also adopted in common use. They were a
privileged class, and must originally have been
a rough breed who made fighting their vocation.
Coming to profess great honour and great privileges,
and correspondingly great responsibilities,
they soon felt the need of a common standard
of behaviour, especially as they were always on a
belligerent footing and belonged to different clans.</p>

<p>"'Fair play in fight!' What fertile germs<span class="pagenum">[319]</span><a name="index319"></a>
of morality lie in this primitive sense of savagery
and childhood! Is it not the root of military
and civic virtues? We smile (as if we had outgrown
it!) at the boyish desire of the small
Britisher, Tom Brown, 'to leave behind him
the name of a fellow who never bullied a little
boy or turned his back on a big one.' And yet,
who does not know that this desire is the cornerstone
on which moral structures of mighty
dimensions can be reared? May I not go even
so far as to say that the gentlest and most peace-loving
of religions endorses this aspiration?
This desire of Tom's is the basis on which the
greatness of England is largely built, and it will
not take us long to discover that Bushido does
not stand on a lower pedestal. If fighting in
itself, be it offensive or defensive, is, as Quakers
rightly testify, brutal and wrong, we can still
say with Lessing, 'We know from what failings
our virtue springs.' Sneaks and cowards are
epithets of the worst opprobrium to healthy,
simple natures. Childhood begins life with
those notions, as does also knighthood; but
as life grows larger and its relations become
many-sided, the early faith seeks sanction from
higher authority and more rational sources for
its own justification, satisfaction, and development.
If military systems had operated alone,
without higher moral support, how far short of
chivalry would the moral ideal have fallen!<span class="pagenum">[320]</span><a name="index320"></a>
In Europe Christianity, interpreted with concessions
convenient to chivalry, infused it nevertheless
with a spiritual ideal. 'Religion, war,
and glory were the three rules of a perfect Christian
knight,' says Lamartine."</p>

<p>Bushido has no written laws; it has been
handed down as a tradition from father to son.
Its originator was not a sage like Confucius, not
an ascetic like Buddha; it was the people itself.
It is the immediate expression of past ages,
and, as far as man's memory reaches, the interpreter
of the sentiments of victorious warriors.</p>

<p>With the increasing power of the Samurais
grew also the necessity, as was the case with
knighthood, to purify the atmosphere of their
fortresses by self-prescribed rules. And it lies
in the natural order of things, embracing all
national codes, that those points should be
most carefully guarded on which the people
felt themselves to be weakest.</p>

<p>The first principle, then, was, Justice to all.
The Samurais despise above all things trickery
and deceit, all unfairness. "Adhere inflexibly
to thy principle,"&mdash;thus writes a Bushi&mdash;"and
be ready to die for the sake of duty; but also
be ready to strike and to kill if honour demand
it of thee." And the more the general situation
became degenerated, the more prominent became
the letter of this law in the clash of swords.</p>

<p>The second principle was courage. From his<span class="pagenum">[321]</span><a name="index321"></a>
earliest childhood the Japanese boy was brought
up to be a soldier, and in his education many
points remind us of the old Spartan rigour.
Often the mother would admonish a crying
child with such words as: "Shame not the
honour of thy family; men of this house have
never been known to cry." Or again, she might
stimulate her son's courage by saying: "What
wilt thou say when in battle thou losest arm or
leg?" or, "How wilt thou control thy face
if the Emperor should bid thee to cut off thine
ears or to perform the hara-kiri?" To be
brave was the aim of every boy, and frequently
was he called upon to prove his courage. He
was made to go hungry, to walk great distances,
and in many cases this system of hardening
verged on cruelty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the benevolence of the
Samurai often degenerated into sentimentality,
and the Bushida-nashake&mdash;the warm soldier's
heart&mdash;has become proverbial. To render assistance
to the weak and helpless was one of the
soldier's paramount duties, and, like the Italian
Condottieri and the knights of the Middle Ages
who, although they tyrannized over the people,
were yet anxious to appear civilized and cultured,
and were not blind to their own faults
and cruelties, so the Samurais laid special stress
upon the observance of social forms, and taught
their boys, besides the military arts, such accomplishments<span class="pagenum">[322]</span><a name="index322"></a>
as poetry, music, and other fine arts.</p>

<p>Courteousness became a second nature, and
to this day, although it sometimes may lack
sincerity and has in many cases become an
empty form, Japanese politeness always excites
the astonishment and admiration of the foreigner
on his first arrival in the land. Nippon society
manners are the most complicated and tedious
imaginable. The smallest affairs of everyday
life are circumscribed with the most childish
and elaborate rules. The way to enter a friend's
house, how to address him, what to talk about,
everything is carefully prescribed, even the
slight attention of offering the guest a cup of
tea amounts to a ceremony, regulated in its
minutest details. The Cha-no-yu (tea-drinking),
in truth, is more than a ceremony, it is
a precious tradition, a rite, illustrating the
refinement of taste and the imagination of the
people.</p>

<p class="caption">MARSHALL OYAMA<br /><i>Copyright, Nops Ltd.</i><br />
[To face page 322]</p></div>

<p>The third fundamental principle of Bushido
is honour; more particularly expressed in
Guai-bun and Men-moku, which form the basis
of the conception of the Samurai. But even
the valour of the most heroic Samurai is as
nothing compared to his pride and vanity, and
to a certain extent these two qualities are still
striking characteristics of the nation. Extreme
sensitiveness and readiness to take offence are
the unavoidable consequences of such highly<span class="pagenum">[323]</span><a name="index323"></a>
developed self-constrictions. The "affaires
d'honneur" of the Latin races, and the often
mistaken chivalry of the German "Junker" are
but weak parallels to the sensitiveness of the
Bushi. The hot-blooded Samurai was offended
on every possible occasion, and many an innocent
life has been sacrificed to this intensely
developed military pride.</p>

<p>Whole volumes have been written upon the
manner in which these "questions of honour"
should be dealt with, and more than one tragic
page had its comical features also. Thus, for
instance, the story is told of a Busiaki, who
killed a peasant for drawing his attention to the
fact that there was an insect on his coat. For,
argued the Busiaki, vermin feed on beasts, and
therefore his remark amounts to an insult.
And as the simple peasant was not entitled to
give satisfaction for the supposed offence in
any other manner, he had to pay for it with
his life, in order that the honour of the Busiaki
might be cleared. This condition of things
might lead also to vengeance and suicide, and
the favourite form of the latter was "hara-kiri,"
which has attained world-wide fame. It is
suicide by cutting open the abdomen, and this
custom was one of the institutions by which
distant Japan has been so often misjudged.
To the European the idea is revolting and sinful,
but the pride and imagination of that far-away<span class="pagenum">[324]</span><a name="index324"></a>
people magnified it into a sublime action.</p>

<p>The most sympathetic characters in the
history of Japan have thus ended their days,
and many popular heroes of national epics thus
gave up their lives. In every Japanese drama
there is at least one hero who dies on the stage
in this manner, amid the thundering applause
of an appreciative audience. If not a punishment,
the motive for committing suicide is
almost always an exaggerated conception, not
of despair, but of offended dignity or vanity.
And like every action of this enigmatical people,
hara-kiri and supuku became in time a ceremony,
in which every detail of the proceedings
was carefully formulated. The victim, dressed
in white, and with unmoved countenance, had
to perform the operation with a sharp-edged
sword. This formality gone through in the
supreme manner in which Bushido prescribed
it, and the personal vanity being apparently
satisfied, the victim seemed not to feel the bodily
suffering, and faced his death with calmness. To
realize the pagan standpoint of hara-kiri I will
quote the following lines of the Japanese author.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be understood as asserting
religious or even moral justification of suicide,
but the high estimate placed upon honour was
ample excuse with many for taking one's own
life. Death involving a question of honour
was accepted in Bushido as a key to the solution<span class="pagenum">[325]</span><a name="index325"></a>
of many complex problems, so that to an ambitious
Samurai a natural departure from life
seemed a rather tame affair and a consummation
not devoutly to be wished. I dare say that
many Westerners will admit the fascination of,
if not a positive admiration for, the sublime
composure with which Cato, Brutus, Petronius,
and a host of other ancient worthies, terminated
their own earthly existence. Is it too bold to
hint that the death of the first of the philosophers
was partly suicidal? When we are told so
minutely by his pupils how their master willingly
submitted to the mandate of the state&mdash;which
he knew was morally mistaken&mdash;in spite of the
possibilities of escape, and how he took up the
cup of hemlock in his own hand, even offering
libation from its deadly contents, do we not
discern in his whole proceeding and demeanour
an act of self-immolation? No physical compulsion
here, as in ordinary cases of execution.
True the verdict of the judges was compulsory;
it said, 'Thou shalt die, and that by thine own
hand.' If suicide meant no more than dying
by one's own hand, Socrates was a clear case of
suicide. But nobody would charge him with
a crime; Plato, who was averse to it, would
not call his master a suicide. Now, my readers
will understand that hara-kiri, or seppuku, was
not a mere suicidal process. It was an institution,
legal and ceremonial. An invention of the<span class="pagenum">[326]</span><a name="index326"></a>
Middle Ages, it was a process by which warriors
could expiate their crimes, apologize for errors,
escape from disgrace, redeem their friends, or
prove their sincerity. When enforced as a
legal punishment it was practised with due ceremony.
It was a refinement of self-destruction,
and none could perform it without the utmost
coolness of temper and composure of demeanour,
and for these reasons it was particularly befitting
the profession of bushi."</p>

<p><i>Kataki-ushi</i>, or vengeance, is another strong
feature of national feeling. Contrary to the
Christian doctrine of forgiveness, the Japan of
olden days endeavoured to exalt the original
instinct of human nature, "an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth," into a decree. And how
deep this notion has rooted itself into the hearts
of the people is best illustrated by the story of
the forty-seven Ronins, which everybody in
Japan knows by heart, and which is the favourite
nursery tale of each Nippon child.</p>

<p>Simple as the story is, it is very characteristic.
A nobleman is betrayed by his adversary
and put to death. Forty-seven of his followers
become bandits and swear to revenge their
lord. After many vicissitudes the object of
their revenge falls into their hands and they kill
him. When brought to justice all the forty-seven
commit hara-kiri.</p>

<p>Their graves remain to this day in the grove<span class="pagenum">[327]</span><a name="index327"></a>
of Siba, and it is one of the first places visited
by country people who come to Tokio. Devout
hands keep the modest little tombstones supplied
with wreaths of fresh flowers. And thus
the forty-seven Ronins have become the most
popular heroes of the nation, because their
offence and expiation interpret one of the most
salient features characteristic of the race,
which, judged from a national standard, shines
in a different light as we can see from the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have thus seen the Bushido institution
of suicide; we will now see whether its sister
institution of revenge has its mitigating features.
I hope I can dispose of the question in a few
words, since a similar institution&mdash;or call it
custom, as you will&mdash;prevailed among all peoples,
and has not yet become entirely obsolete, as
attested by the continuance of duelling and
lynching. Among a savage tribe which has
no marriage, adultery is not a sin, so in a period
which has no criminal court murder is not a
crime, and only the vigilant vengeance of the
victim's people preserves social order. 'What
is the most beautiful thing on earth?' said
Osiris to Horus. The reply was, 'To avenge
a parent's wrongs.' To which a Japanese would
have added 'and a nearer's.' In revenge there
is something which satisfies one's sense of
justice. The avenger reasons: 'My good father<span class="pagenum">[328]</span><a name="index328"></a>
did not deserve death&mdash;he who killed him did
great evil. My father, if he were alive, would
not tolerate a deed like this. Heaven itself
hates wrong-doing. It is the will of my father,
it is the will of heaven, that the evil-doer should
cease from his work. He must perish by my
hand, because he shed my father's blood; I who
am his flesh and blood must shed the murderer's.
The same heaven shall not shelter him and me.'
The logic is simple and childish, but it shows an
innate sense of exact balance and equal justice.
Our sense of revenge is as exact as our mathematical
faculty, and until both terms of the
equation are satisfied we cannot get over the
sense of something undone. Both of these
institutions of suicide and revenge lost their
<i>raison d'être</i> at the promulgation of the criminal
code. The sense of justice satisfied, there is no
need of Kataki-uchi. As to Hara-kiri, though
it, too, has no existence <i>de jure</i>, we still hear of
it from time to time, and shall continue to hear
I am afraid, as long as the past is remembered."</p>

<p>In spite of his valour, his passion for war,
his thirst for revenge, the Samurai always preserved
in his demeanour the utmost calm.
Bushido ordained that a knight was never to
show either joy or anger. And while remarking
that the foreigner in Japan is struck by the often
exaggerated politeness of the people, I should
have added that he is certainly no less impressed<span class="pagenum">[329]</span><a name="index329"></a>
by the inexpressiveness of their faces. Whether
sad or joyful, they always wear the same conventional
smile, which is sometimes cold as ice,
sometimes nervous, or in cases of strong emotion
passes into subdued laughter; but traces of
really deep emotion are never visible.</p>

<p>What a Baldasare Castiglione or a Lord
Chesterfield attempted to exemplify in the West,
was bred in the blood of these people as the
highest form of good manners. I have seen
weddings and witnessed funeral processions where
the family on either occasion wore exactly the
same expression. In emotions of any kind that
conventional smile alone betrays their feelings.</p>

<p>That same smile is on every countenance at
great national festivals. With that smile wives
took leave of their husbands, children of their
fathers, mothers of their sons, when the troops
started for the battle-field. The outward form and
expression of it remains the same always. The face,
or rather the mask that is worn on the stage of life,
as in the theatre of ancient Greece, never changes.
No matter if the piece enacted change in its
course to be a comedy, tragedy, or a drama.
So it was ordained by the code of Bushido,
which, very likely because it was an unwritten
law, came to be all the more binding.</p>

<p>Bushido thus had its own ethical laws, its own
religious tenets. As the knight of the Middle Ages
created his own rules of life for use within his<span class="pagenum">[330]</span><a name="index330"></a>
own turreted stronghold&mdash;a code which scarcely
held good beyond the trenches of the castle,
but which at the same time he magnified into
a divine law, a "Gottesurtheil"&mdash;so also the
Samurai created his own dogmas.</p>

<p>The basis of his creed is Buddhism mixed
with the doctrines of Confucius and Shintoism,
the primitive faith of the nation. Originally
this was nature worship and the cult of the sun,
but subsequently it came to be extended to the
person of the Mikado. The Samurai thus elevated
his emperor into a deity, or rather an
idol, and the emperor, gradually more and more
isolated from his people, passed his days within
the walls of his palace in a series of ritualistic
ceremonies, while the burden of the government
was laid upon the Shogun, who acted at the
same time as Regent and Generalissimo. Loyalty
and devotion to their ruler were exalted into
a cult. The person of the Mikado was sacred
and inviolable. Land and people were, so to
speak, his personal property, to do with as he
liked. His smallest wish was a command, the
blind fulfilment of which was incumbent upon
every citizen of the state. The first petition
in the prayers of the Samurai was always for
his emperor, and the second for his country.
And if with us the first gift a child receives is
a little cross, in token of his Christian calling,
so the Japanese mother of old would place a<span class="pagenum">[331]</span><a name="index331"></a>
miniature sword by the side of her babe, to show
that his purpose in life was to defend his emperor,
his country, and his honour. At the age of five
the soldier's boy would receive as a toy a small
real sword, and at fifteen the Samurai was of
age, and from that time he wore a sharp-bladed
weapon.</p>

<p>The sword represented with them more than
a weapon of defence. It was a precious and
symbolic possession. The manner in which
it should be worn was carefully prescribed, and
whenever the warrior sat down to his meal or
to rest, his weapon was placed on a tray by his
side, and woe to the person who touched it with
his foot! Such an offence could be wiped out
only in blood.</p>

<p>As a mark of the highest reverence, the
Samurai raised his sword to his brow, and this
act, too, was made almost into a solemn rite.
Cutlers and sword-makers occupied a privileged
position among the tradespeople, and in
welding the blade, every stroke of the hammer
was accompanied by the repetition of appropriate
sayings and heroic devices. And when
the sword was finished, inlaid with gold and
silver, in Damascene fashion, sharp as an arrow,
and flexible as a Toledo stiletto, it was, of its
kind, a masterpiece. We may safely assert
that neither in painting nor in sculpture, nor
in any branch of industrial art, has Japan ever<span class="pagenum">[332]</span><a name="index332"></a>
reached such a high standard of perfection as
in the manufacture of bronzes and armour.</p>

<p>The most treasured possession of the Samurai,
his pride and his glory, was his sword. And
now, since these weapons have been replaced
by Krupp guns and Maxim bayonets, every
Japanese gentleman preserves the sword of his
ancestors as a token of former greatness.</p>

<p>For times are changed. During the last
forty years the feudal system of Japan has
grown into a representative government, and
the old conservative manner of thought and
conventions have had to give way to progressive
ideas. In outward form the European system
is generally adopted, although intrinsically
many things remain eminently national; for
whether the external form be American or
English, the underlying principle remains
national.</p>

<p>The Japanese are still as determined as of
old; their valour is unchanged; their loyalty
undimmed. The grandson of the Samurai of
antiquity still boasts many of the proclivities
of his ancestors, and above all, the moral law
of Bushido is still in his blood. The masses still
think as their predecessors thought. It is only
in dress and armament that they have changed:
their feelings have remained as of old, and the
same may be said of most of the national institutions,
from the organization of the family to<span class="pagenum">[333]</span><a name="index333"></a>
the constitution of the state. What has changed
is the form and the colour; but the work of
internal transformation is left for future generations
to accomplish.</p>

<p>In order rightly to apprehend the present
situation of Japan, to explain the admirable
military discipline of the soldiers, to understand
why in their blind devotion to their country
they think nothing of sacrificing thousands of
lives, it is necessary to make ourselves acquainted
with the inner workings of the
feudal system, the moral basis of their actions,
the principles of Bushido and Samuraism. For
it is only by a full knowledge of all these
influences, and the conditions of the past,
that we can arrive at a true understanding of
its present strength.</p>

<p>The life and the death of the forty-seven
Ronins may account for the fixed determination
wherewith the troops met their death before
the walls of Port Arthur. Nippon's sons are
in the first instance warriors. They have fought
for centuries; they have fought for the honour
of their country, they have shed their blood
for the glory of the Mikado, and with the same
stoic determination they now fight to glorify
their land.</p>

<p>To form a better idea of the Japanese army
we must indeed bear in mind the peculiar features
embodied in the principle of Bushido and<span class="pagenum">[334]</span><a name="index334"></a>
the Samurais code. Even the true character
of the Japanese youths studying in Western
lands and wearing European clothing, can only
be adequately understood by those who have
been to a certain extent acquainted with their
fathers. And the same applies to the whole
of modern progressive, fighting Japan; its
administration, its state organization, its politics,
its military ambition, its social agitations,
its industrial developments, and the entire
transformation of its labour.</p>

<p>Just as we can only understand the existing
condition of the land and of the people, by
studying its evolution in the past, so with
regard to its future development it is only from
psychological features that we can draw definite
conclusions. During my stay in Japan I was
particularly interested in collecting data from the
personal experiences of those Europeans who had
resided there for many years. Besides the members
of the various European legations it was
chiefly the commercial class and the merchants
who furnished me with many valuable details.
Daily intercourse with the different grades of
Japanese society has shown me the life of the
people from many varied points of view. Particularly
interesting to me were the experiences
of the European teachers attached to the numerous
civil and military schools. They were all
unanimous in praise of their pupils, for their<span class="pagenum">[335]</span><a name="index335"></a>
industry and perseverance.</p>

<p>Like most Asiatics, the Japanese are fond of
study and of books in general, and even the
school-children seem to do their lessons with
pleasure. They are quick and sharp, ambitious
and untiring in their zeal. The national inclination
of the Japanese tends towards technical
science. Everything practical appeals to them,
and even philosophical problems are looked at
from a utilitarian point of view.</p>

<p>The course of Modern Philosophy at the
University of Tokio gave me some striking
illustrations of the manner in which the
Japanese look upon the great thinkers of
the West. Upon this point I have dwelt more
at large in another work of mine, and I will
therefore only mention here, that as in science
material rather than the moral questions appeal
to them, so in the case of philosophy it is the
manner in which Western thought bears upon
the imagination which takes hold of them, more
than the way in which the conclusions are
deduced by strictly logical processes.</p>

<p>But the inner life, the soul of the nation, is
unquestionably best known to the missionaries
who have laboured among them for generations.
Since the time of St. Francis Xavier, who landed
in Japan as early as the sixteenth century and
founded the first churches and schools, there
has, with longer or shorter intervals, been a<span class="pagenum">[336]</span><a name="index336"></a>
supply of priests and teachers from Europe.</p>

<p>In the course of the seventeenth century, long
accounts from Japan came to the Holy See,
giving graphic descriptions of the condition of
the land. In these are detailed the first missionary
attempts, which met with such unexpected
success, and these reports present a very
vivid picture of the days when people accepted
Christianity by hundreds and thousands, and
nearly the whole of Southern Japan became
Christianized. Later followed the long period
of religious persecution, of suffering and torture.
Yet in spite of so much cruel bloodshed, in spite
of the numerous hecatombs of martyrs, there
are still some direct descendants of the first
Christian families.</p>

<p>Since the middle of the nineteenth century
Christianity has received a fresh impetus, and
at present Japan is divided into four dioceses,
at the head of which is the Archbishop of Tokio.
Scattered throughout the land are many missionary
establishments and Christian communities.
In the larger towns many primary and middle
schools are established, and educational institutions
for girls exist in large numbers too. The
orphanages are most successful, and the leper establishments&mdash;where
those living dead are cared
for by the nuns at the sacrifice of their own lives&mdash;cannot
fail to excite universal admiration.</p>

<p>Although at present the public spirit of Japan<span class="pagenum">[337]</span><a name="index337"></a>
does not show much enthusiasm concerning
religious questions, Christianity is at any rate
free from persecution. The Japanese of the
present day is more or less indifferent to matters
of religion. He seeks satisfaction in earthly
goods. The old Buddhistic faith has lost much
of its influence, and the adherents of the doctrine
of Confucius are rapidly decreasing in
number. With the introduction of the new
constitution, the Government has resuscitated
the ancient Shintoism and made it the religion
of the state. The sovereign, the Mikado, himself
professes this faith. Shintoism, or nature-worship,
now chiefly serves as one of the great
vehicles of patriotic force. Its ceremonies are
most primitive, consisting mainly of short
prayers of a sentence or two, and of bowing of
the head and the clasping of hands. Their
chapels are also of the simplest. They are
plain, four-walled wooden structures without
ornaments or pictures or decorations of any
kind. The only conspicuous object in them
is the symbol of their deity, a smoothly polished
metal disc, representing the sun.</p>

<p>But this religion, which was universally re-proclaimed
from one day to another by imperial
command, does not appear to satisfy the masses&mdash;at
any rate not the devout among them&mdash;who
prefer to seek peace and consolation in constant
prayer and supplication, and therefore continue<span class="pagenum">[338]</span><a name="index338"></a>
to visit the Buddhist temples and convents.
The cultured and more advanced classes are
more and more interested in learning the tenets
of the Christian faith; yet, although it is doubtful
whether Christianity will ever make much
progress in Japan, it is certain that Western
civilization, being based on Christianity, is very
deficient without its moral support. The leading
circles in Japan are conscious of this fact,
and realize more and more that a purely material
life, and the lack of all spiritual comfort, can
never give lasting satisfaction.</p>

<p>Should the day arrive when the people will
abandon their ancient beliefs, without having
had the opportunity of becoming familiar with a
higher creed, a sad deterioration must be the inevitable
result. And the nation may be exposed
to a similar danger should the old moral basis
of their existence be shaken by the too sudden
introduction of new conditions, and before the
growing generation has had time to reach a
standard of spiritual development corresponding
to it. Thus far the rapid progress of Japan
has been confined chiefly to material efforts;
there has not been leisure to give sufficient care
to the spiritual and moral needs of the people.
The first aim and object of the young Japanese is
to become rich, great, and mighty. Blindly they
follow the example of the commercial Powers
of Western Europe. With marvellous rapidity<span class="pagenum">[339]</span><a name="index339"></a>
they have assimilated all that was external, all
that was palpable. The Japanese fleet in the
harbour of Nagasaki is a marvel of efficiency,
while Kobe and Yokohama, as commercial
towns, compare favourably with some of the
largest trade centres of the United States and
Britain. Osaka and Tokio, encouraging factories
of every kind, have secured to Japan the
market of the East, and life in the principal
cities is in almost every respect a faithful copy
of European institutions. But whether the
people are essentially happier, with this external
veneer, and the strong strain and high
pressure it involves, is quite another thing, and
a question of great importance to all who have
the welfare of the nation seriously at heart.
A too rapid transformation of existing conditions
might very easily lead to an economic
crisis, symptoms of which are already beginning
to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>Greater still would be the danger of a moral
crisis, and equally unavoidable, so long as the
people conform only outwardly to the exigencies
of the newly acquired culture, without realizing
its moral value, and whilst ignoring its spiritual
aims.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum">[340]</span><a name="index340"></a></p>
<p class="center ">II<br />
CHINA</p>

<p>China is in almost every respect diametrically
opposed to Japan. In the first place,
the two empires are entirely different in their
geographical features and geological formation.
In China towering mountain crags and
vast, immeasurable plains alternate with one
another. Some of those plains are dreary,
desolate, barren wastes, while in other parts
the ground is closely cultivated, yet wholly
inadequate to feed China's millions. The canals
which traverse the land in all directions are like
so many huge rivers, and the streams sometimes
widen into regular lakes, the borders of which
cannot be descried by the naked eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_340.jpg" alt="On the Yang-tze-kiang" />
<p class="caption">ON THE YANG-TZE-KIANG<br />After a water-colour drawing by the author<br />
"And the streams sometimes widen into regular lakes, the borders of which
cannot be descried by the naked eye"<br />
[To face page 340]</p></div>

<p>Everything is large, gigantic, in this yellow
empire, and even in those parts where the
country offers neither geographical advantages
nor natural charms, we are impressed by its
vastness, its immensity, as all that is truly
great is imposing.</p>

<p>Japan, with its groves of evergreen, its flowering
meadows, its smiling, graceful scenery,
delights the beholder; but China, with its wide
expanses, its enormous tracts of land and its
virgin forests, captivates us by its sombre magnitude.</p>

<p>And if the difference between the external<span class="pagenum">[341]</span><a name="index341"></a>
conditions of the two yellow empires is great,
still greater is the distinction between the
peoples which inhabit these neighbouring states.</p>

<p>Physically the Japanese is small, but strong
and wiry&mdash;he is all muscle. The Chinaman is
big, broad-shouldered, and his nervous system
is more developed. The Japanese is before all
things a man of action. He lives in a perpetual
state of motion, he is always doing, and works
from morning till night. His marvellous vital
power finds expression in a multitude of ways.
He acts hastily, often too hastily to give himself
time to consider his actions. The Chinaman,
on the contrary, is reflective. Before he undertakes
anything he thinks out every detail of it,
and his intelligence thus greatly reduces his
actual labour. The Chinese coolies and labourers
are like so many intelligent machines. They
work imperturbably, with systematic precision,
and always attain their end. Instructive instances
of this may be seen among the Chinese
labourers abroad, where a Chinaman does the
work of two Europeans with half the trouble.
The secret of the advantage which they thus
gain over their Western rivals lies first in the
right distribution of labour, and secondly in
that great moral quality which ensures their
success, namely temperance. The Chinese working
in the fields of California, in the gardens
of Australia, or as miners in South America,<span class="pagenum">[342]</span><a name="index342"></a>
are good examples of the vitality and energy
which these people possess.</p>

<p>It is foolish to say&mdash;as I have often heard it
said&mdash;that the advantage lies simply in the
stronger constitution of the race; on the contrary,
very often we must admit that the true
advantage lies in their intellectual superiority.
These national characteristics may be best
observed in the lower classes, and particularly
in the domestic servant. Every European residing
in China acknowledges the superiority
of the native servant above any other. He
is quiet in his movements, intelligent, industrious;
and it is almost incredible how
quickly these Chinese peasants learn to anticipate
the wishes of their European masters.
At the foreign Embassies at Pekin and at the
Consulates of the interior, I observed how the
pigtailed cook prepares the most delicate
dishes according to the latest art in French
cooking; the blue-robed house-servant keeps
the establishment in perfect order, and the day
labourer performs his task with accurate precision.</p>

<p>But it is on a journey that we have the best
opportunity for learning to appreciate the
salient qualities of the Chinese servant. Far
in the interior, in lonely, barren regions, our
yellow companion always found ways and means
to prepare a warm meal for us, and to improvise<span class="pagenum">[343]</span><a name="index343"></a>
a tent or hut wherein we could pass the night.
The missionaries in China tell many stories of
the marvellous resourcefulness of their Chinese
attendants; how they saved the itinerant
pastor from dying of hunger and thirst; how,
if there was nothing better to be had, they
would catch a few sparrows and make a savoury
dish of these tiny birds. And, if even tiny birds
failed, they would make pasties of locusts or a
dinner from leaves and grasses.</p>

<p>Of the Chinaman it may be said with truth
that he never gives in. This, indeed, is one of
the chief characteristics of his race. He is resourceful
even where the European has given up
in despair. And we must have the courage to
face this truth. The recent hostility against
the Chinese coolies in San Francisco, and the
laws against yellow labour lately put in force
in Australasia, are the expression of it. It is true
that among the Chinese labourers abroad there
are many spoiled characters, drunkards and
card-players; but I venture to think that it
was not out of consideration for them that the
decrees were issued which prevent the Chinese
coolie from enriching the public-houses in
America and Australia through his intemperate
habits, nor yet to save him from wasting his
substance in the foul quarters of the harbour
towns. No; all these measures rather indicate
the existence of a racial jealousy, for as a rule<span class="pagenum">[344]</span><a name="index344"></a>
the Chinaman is more industrious and more
temperate than the European. The question
of Chinese labour has in our times become one
of the economic problems of the Far East, of
America and Australia, and recently also of
South Africa. However, this is not the place
to enter further into this question. Here, as
relating to our subject, it is only of importance
to note that the coolie who belongs to the
lowest class of Chinese society, although he
is poor, has fewer wants, and receives smaller
wages, than the labourer of any other country,
does not on that account do less work or work
of an inferior quality. On the contrary, both
intellectually and physically, he is generally not
behind his social equals of other nationalities.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_344.jpg" alt="In the flowery land" />
<p class="caption">IN THE FLOWERY LAND<br />"The coolie, who belongs to the lowest class of Chinese society, although he is poor, has fewer wants, and receives smaller wages,
does not on that account do less work"<br />
[To face page 344]</p></div>

<p>Very marked also are the virtues of the
Chinese tradespeople and merchants; in other
words, of the lower middle class. Here again,
what strikes one most is the amount of work
done and the indefatigable zeal of the people.
In the second place we note with surprise the
simplicity of their way of living, their evident
contentment with the bare necessities of life,
even among the fairly well-to-do, and their
desire to be and abide in the state of life in
which they have been born. The joiner's son
becomes a joiner, the builder's son a builder.
Only by way of exception does a Chinaman
strike out in a new direction. The height of his<span class="pagenum">[345]</span><a name="index345"></a>
ambition is, at most, to become a better joiner
or a better builder than his father was before
him&mdash;to improve in quality more than in quantity.
Another prominent feature of the Chinese
trader is his respect for his caste. As in Japan
with the Daimios and Samurais, whose moral
basis was a military one, the pledged word was
sacred, and the white flag inviolable, so the
peaceable trader of China, whose life is governed
by the civil code, is always true to his bargain.
There is scarcely an instance on record in which
a Chinese tradesman has broken his word. In
the large commercial towns, overcrowded with
merchants and goods from all parts of the world,
written contracts with Chinamen are hardly
ever thought necessary. Market prices and
rates of exchange may vary&mdash;and in many
cases the local producer incurs heavy losses by
a premature selling of the harvest to the European
agent&mdash;but when a sale is once concluded,
a Chinaman never attempts to evade his obligations.</p>

<p>European bankers and wholesale dealers tell
us that the difference between China and Japan
in this respect is great. In the case of the latter,
unfilled engagements and arrears of payment
are a standing rule in the ledger accounts of
most Continental firms, and considerable loss
is sometimes incurred by these houses through
the avarice and the subtle devices of some<span class="pagenum">[346]</span><a name="index346"></a>
traders. The Japanese to a certain extent, in
imitation of the Latin nations, aims at becoming
rich, or at least well-to-do, quickly. It is his
object to amass sufficient wealth, by a few
profitable speculations, to enable him to retire
into private life.</p>

<p>The Chinaman, on the contrary&mdash;like the
Anglo-Saxon&mdash;makes trade his vocation in life.
"Life is business," he says.</p>

<p>And so in China as in England, or perhaps
even more in America, the industrial classes
and the merchants have become the ruling
power in the country. Socially they constitute
a privileged class. As in Anglo-Saxon
states the Chambers of Commerce and the
Trade Unions, so in China the ancient Guilds
arrange all business matters for themselves.
The Guilds, indeed, are a most important institution
in Chinese society. Their influence is
not confined to trade and commerce; it dominates
many other relations in life, and the often
secret resolutions passed by the Guilds are of
great force in matters of local administration
and general politics.</p>

<p>Some of the larger Guild or Club houses are
well worth our attention. From an architectural
point of view they are good specimens of
old Chinese style. They generally consist of
several buildings, or more correctly, of a row of
halls and pagodas, separated by flower-gardens<span class="pagenum">[347]</span><a name="index347"></a>
with small fishponds, and courts with shady
groves. Besides the official departments there
are conversation-halls and tea-rooms, much
frequented by the members after the transaction
of business. The most magnificent of
these houses are found in the interior, in the
cities on the Hoang-ho and the Yang-tze-kiang.
The club-house of the tea-merchants at Hankau
ranks first in point of artistic perfection. It is
a good specimen of the national taste. Slender
pagodas, china towers, trim gardens, boldly
arched bridges, all harmonious in form and
colour, testify to the marvellous creative genius
of this people. Never have I seen such finely
pointed, tent-shaped roofs, such delicately
tapered gables, such carving, and such tracery.
Never could I have believed it possible for any
architect to build, in fragile clay and line pottery,
such bastion-like walls, and towers reaching up
into the sky, and surmounted by a roof of porcelain
as delicate and rare as a precious teacup.
These Guild-houses are truly store-houses of
old Chinese art treasures, and in them receptions
and dramatic performances often take
place.</p>

<p>Among the musical and theatrical entertainments
of China, there are some which continue
from morning till night. On their merit, however,
a European can hardly be expected to
pass a fair judgment. The queerness and<span class="pagenum">[348]</span><a name="index348"></a>
quaintness of the performance is what strikes
one most at first. Yet among the old dramatists
there were many of first-rate talent, and
life and knowledge of the world were very forcibly
expressed by them, but in a form unfamiliar
to the European mind. The Chinese, we
think, are sometimes too realistic and somewhat
formal actors; but yet, even in their modern,
degenerate, historical pieces, we find frequent
traces of the prehistoric ideals of the Greek
drama.</p>

<p>The musical accompaniment of the performance
is no less interesting. Contrary to the
generally accepted idea that the Chinese have
no feeling for music, I venture to think that
Chinese music, although it may be discordant
and unpleasing to the European ear, is not
without great merits. We should not forget
that the Chinese musical scale is set quite differently
from ours, and is offensive to us chiefly
because it is unfamiliar. But notwithstanding
its deafening shrillness, it has great rhythmical
power; and after all it only sounds harsh to us
on account of its complexity. It must not be
forgotten that their musical tones are not, as in
the West, divided into two, but into four parts.
In fact, they have not only half, but third and
fourth gradations.</p>

<p>The same with regard to their plastic art&mdash;the
foreigner is easily apt to consider the external<span class="pagenum">[349]</span><a name="index349"></a>
form only. He appreciates or rejects it according
as it comes up to our Western standard of
beauty or not, but does not stop to look at it
from the national cultural point of view. And
yet it is impossible to understand Chinese art
without doing so. In China art was confined
to experts, while in Japan it acquired an ever-increasing
popular character. But the Chinese
is by far the higher form of art. The Chinese
have always been the teachers and pioneers in
all matters of thought and creative genius in
the Far East. Architecture, sculpture, painting,
with all their various ramifications, date
back to the remote ages of Chinese antiquity.
What we have on record of the time of the first
emperors gives us some idea of their refinement
and of the art treasures then already in existence,
and of still greater value in this respect
are the few known monuments of the Shung
Dynasty and of the subsequent Mongol period.</p>

<p>Interesting above all are remains of buildings
dating back to the Ming Age, which still exist
in considerable numbers. Chinese art surprises
one principally on account of its force and of
the originating power manifested by it. In
their colossal structures we chiefly admire the
height of the pagodas, the length of the bridges;
we are struck by the earnestness of the conception,
the magnitude of the design, the masterful
execution, the concentration of thought; all<span class="pagenum">[350]</span><a name="index350"></a>
these appeal to us even now, in their dilapidated
condition. The Imperial Palace at Pekin, although
in ruins, is still one of the most magnificent
structures in the world. And the same
might be said of all other branches of art. We
see it in the old bronze statues, in the delicate
porcelain work, the exquisite carvings, and the
precious cut stones. These relics in themselves
may leave us cold, design and colour may not
be to our taste, but the artistic idea, and above
all the artistic ideal, underlying all these masterpieces,
and the power of execution, cannot fail
to impress any one at all interested in art.</p>

<p>We must remember that although the Chinese
conception of art is so different from ours, the
interest of it to us lies not exclusively in the
productions themselves, but rather in the mind
which produced them. The longer we associate
with the Chinese the more we feel attracted to
them, the more we recognize their worth, embodied
in the versatile spheres of art and culture.
In process of time we learn to appreciate,
not only the civilization of Chinese antiquity&mdash;which
was centuries in advance of ours, and
had already reached a high state of development
when Europe was still peopled by wild, unknown
hordes&mdash;but we also begin to appreciate the
different embodiments of that strange culture
too.</p>

<p>When we study the history of the people<span class="pagenum">[351]</span><a name="index351"></a>
in the days of their glory, or read the biographies
of their great emperors, we almost become reconciled
even to the inferiority of their existing
form of government. Only as we glance through
the works of their sages and great writers, who
lived many centuries before our era, do we get
a somewhat clearer idea of the intellectual
capacity of this race, whose culture extended
beyond their own boundaries far into neighbouring
lands; penetrated to the uttermost borders
of the East, and finally&mdash;making its way across
Korea&mdash;laid the foundation of Japanese civilization.</p>

<p>This primeval culture has crumbled away.
Only here and there among the ruins do we find
glowing fragments and brilliant pieces of it;
but even these remnants fill us with genuine
wonder, and are eloquent witnesses to the greatness
and strength of the nation's genius.</p>

<p>What has remained strong, above all, to this
day, amid the complete general disorganization,
is the race itself, as such. The prejudice against
the Chinese may still be as general as ever, yet
one cannot help drawing attention to the fact
that neglected, uneducated, and wretched as
the population is at present, there are everywhere
abundant proofs of unflagging energy
and exceptional capacity for work. These two
characteristics strike one most forcibly among
the lower classes, while among the partisans of<span class="pagenum">[352]</span><a name="index352"></a>
the European movement, the progressive mercantile
middle class, or among the scientists,
scholars, and statesmen, who still occupy the
old classical standpoint, a rare power of perception
and intellectual development is worthy
of recognition.</p>

<p>The greatest living statesman of China is
undoubtedly Chang-chi-Tung. His influence as
viceroy of the two important provinces of Hupek
and Hunan is supreme. Since the death of
Li Hung-Chang he ranks first in the estimation
of his countrymen. He may not possess an
equally keen insight and the extraordinary
knowledge of human nature which the late
viceroy had at his command, and he may lack
his political shrewdness, but from a moral point
of view Chang-chi-Tung occupies an incomparably
higher level. He is not only a statesman,
but he is also a sage and a philosopher. He is
a follower of Confucius and every inch a patriot.
He is said to encourage Confucianism among
his countrymen, but he is tolerant towards other
religious convictions, and within the radius of
his colossal viceregal dominions, hospitality is
shown to all, including Christians. In politics
he is moderate, and although conservative in
principle, he favours practical reforms and innovations,
as may be gathered from the many
industrial establishments in his capital. Personally
he owns cotton-mills and factories, built<span class="pagenum">[353]</span><a name="index353"></a>
a few years ago by Belgian engineers, which,
under European management, have from the
first yielded good results. Gradually the foreign
employés have been replaced by natives, and
at present the whole administration of this extensive
concern is in the hands of natives.</p>

<p>The mercantile spirit of this enterprising
viceroy is not in any way inferior to his
political genius. Brick-kilns, china-, glass-, and
iron-works and gun-factories, besides a whole
network of railways, have been established
under his administration. His soldiers, instructed
by German officers, are probably the
best drilled and best organized troops of the
empire, and his well-equipped, excellently armed
cavalry is the pride of the land. His energies,
however, are more particularly centred upon the
educational problem. He favours practical instruction,
and in order to further this, he proposes
to convert some of the unused pagodas
into schools. Chang-chi-Tung, himself a writer
of no mean order, is perhaps the best read, and
certainly the most influential Chinese author
living. His work entitled "China's Only Hope,"
published shortly after the last war with Japan,
caused a great sensation. Several million copies
were issued, and the Emperor himself wrote
a dedication for it. This book is of great interest,
not only for the Chinese, but also for us, because
it throws a strong side-light upon the character<span class="pagenum">[354]</span><a name="index354"></a>
of the author and upon the party to which at
present the most important portion of the
Chinese belong.</p>

<p>A few extracts will give some idea of the
tendency of the work:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Comparing the history of China during the
last two years with the history of Europe during
the last fifty years, the question involuntarily
arises whether the governments of Western
states can furnish examples of benevolence,
self-sacrifice, and loyalty equal to ours.</p>

<p>"Although China is not as rich as Europe,
its people, whether rich or poor, high or low,
enjoy greater freedom. European states may
be very powerful, their ruling classes very rich,
but the labouring population is disproportionately
poor and miserable, and frequently unjustly
dealt with. A system of government
which ignores such social contrasts, or rather,
which creates them, can never be an example
for us to follow."</p>

<p>Elsewhere he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The standpoint of the West is practical;
we, on the contrary, are idealistic. Our sages
and our scholars have taught us that the happiness
of a nation consists in the well-being of its
people. Our religions teach us equality and
charity; our customs, the organization of our
family life, all social institutions, point to this
one thing; to make the millions of our people<span class="pagenum">[355]</span><a name="index355"></a>
contented."</p>

<p>Again, in another passage, speaking of inventions,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not contest the technical superiority
of the West. I myself am a promoter of progress,
but I do not desire that our institutions, which
have stood for centuries, should be transformed
all in a moment. I note with satisfaction&mdash;speaking
of progress&mdash;that the same elements
which at first raged so fiercely against the introduction
of railways and steam navigation, have
now become the most staunch supporters of
these useful inventions."</p>

<p>An equally interesting specimen of a modern
Chinaman's opinion of European affairs, is a
pamphlet which appeared some years ago, in
the English language, under the title of "Letters
from a Viceroy's Residence."</p>

<p>The author is a young Celestial who spent
many years in the West, and upon his return
was appointed secretary to one of the viceroys.
The object of these letters was, in the first place,
to convince his master of the fact that, in spite
of his long residence in the West, he had remained
a good patriot. In the second place,
he hoped to awaken the interests of the Queen
Regent. Several of these letters appeared first
in the columns of an English newspaper, published
in Japan, and unquestionably praise is
due to the author, Ku-hung-ming, at least for<span class="pagenum">[356]</span><a name="index356"></a>
his zeal in making himself acquainted with the
various languages and literatures of Western
lands. The power of his discernment and discrimination
may be seen from the manner in
which he points out what there is defective,
puerile, and unintelligible amongst us. When
he condemns shortcomings he generally does
so by quoting our own writers against us, and
he exposes our mistakes to the merciless scourge
of our own criticism. There is not a writer,
a statesman, or a philosopher, of any note, to
whom he does not in some way or other appeal.
He concludes an elaborate study of the civilizations
of the West and the East with the words of
Carlyle: "Europe is an Anarchy, with a policeman
at its head"; and he quotes Ruskin, to
apply to China the theory that "culture means
a society of cultured beings."</p>

<p>"To the ordinary European trader it seems
no doubt a strange thing that we should object
to what he describes as the opening out of our
national resources. Viewing everything, as he
habitually does, from the standpoint of profit
and loss, he conceives that if it can be shown
that a certain course will lead to the increase of
wealth, it follows that that is the course that
ought to be adopted. The opening of China
to his country and his trade he believes will have
this result; and he concludes that it is our
interest to welcome rather than to resist his<span class="pagenum">[357]</span><a name="index357"></a>
enterprise. From his point of view he is justified;
but his point of view is not ours. We
are accustomed, before adopting any grave measures
of policy, to estimate their effects, not merely
on the sum total of our wealth, but (which we
conceive to be a very different thing) on our
national well-being. You, as always, are thinking
of the means of living, we, of the quality of
the life lived. And when you ask us, as you
do in effect, to transform our whole society,
to convert ourselves from a nation of agriculturists
to a nation of traders and manufacturers,
to sacrifice to an imaginary prosperity our
political and economic independence, and to
revolutionize, not only our industry, but our
manners, morals, and institutions, we may be
pardoned if we first take a critical look at the
effects which have been produced among yourselves
by the conditions you urge us to introduce
in China."</p>

<p>This statement is of peculiar interest as showing
that with regard to European innovations
China occupies a position diametrically opposed
to that of Japan. Evidently China is not
blind where European conditions are concerned.
The Chinese do not ignore the material and
technical advantages and achievements of
Europe. They realize with tolerable clearness
the superior material conditions which modern
life offers. The only point upon which they are<span class="pagenum">[358]</span><a name="index358"></a>
not clear is how far all these innovations help
us to make life more tolerable, and how far
they contribute to the inner satisfaction or
happiness of the people.</p>

<p>"I have learned that the most brilliant discoveries,
the most fruitful applications of inventive
genius, do not of themselves suffice for the
well-being of society, and that an intelligence
which is concentrated exclusively on the production
of labour-saving machines, may easily
work more harm for the dislocation of industry
than it can accomplish good by the increase of
wealth. For the increase of wealth&mdash;that is, of
the means of comfort&mdash;is not to my mind
necessarily good in itself; everything depends
on the way in which the wealth is distributed
and on its effect on the moral character of the
nations. And it is from that point of view
that I look with some dismay upon the prospect
of the introduction of Western methods into
China."</p>

<p>The author then describes at some length,
and perhaps in somewhat too glowing terms,
the cheerfulness, the contentment, the philosophy,
the joy of living of the Chinese people.
He speaks of the strong bond of affection which
unites families, their literary and artistic tastes,
their deep-rooted love of nature, all of which
stand them in such good stead in time of trouble.</p>

<p>"All this is peculiar to our nature, it is the<span class="pagenum">[359]</span><a name="index359"></a>
basis of our inner contentment, a contentment
which no one can give, but which may easily
be taken from us."</p>

<p>Even for the much-criticized, and unquestionably
corrupt institution of the state, the loyal
patriot has a few condoning words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The simple and natural character of our
civilization, the peaceable nature of our people,
above all, the institution of the family, itself
a little state&mdash;a political, social, and economic
unit&mdash;these and other facts have rendered us
independent of government control to an extent
which to Europeans may seem incredible.
Neither the acts nor the omissions of the authorities
at Pekin have any real or permanent effect
on the life of our masses, except so far as they
register the movements of popular sentiment
and demand. Otherwise, as you foreigners
know to your cost, they remain a dead letter.
The government may make conventions and
treaties, but it cannot put them into effect,
except in so far as they are endorsed by public
opinion.... Our fundamental institutions are
no arbitrary inventions of power, they are the
form which the people have given to their lives.
No government created and no government
would think of modifying them.... Law, in
a word, is not with us a rule imposed from above;
it is the formula of the national life, and its
embodiment in practice precedes its inscription<span class="pagenum">[360]</span><a name="index360"></a>
in a code."</p>

<p>Referring to the political disputes between
China and Europe, another Chinese writer says:</p>

<p>"When first your traders came to China it
was not at our invitation; yet we received them,
if not with enthusiasm, at least with tolerance.
So long as they were content to observe our
regulations we were willing to sanction their
traffic, but always on the condition that it
should not disturb our social and political order.
To this condition, in earlier days, your countrymen
consented to conform, and for many years,
in spite of occasional disputes, there was no
serious trouble between them and us. The
trouble arose over a matter in regard to which
you yourselves have hardly ventured to defend
your conduct. A considerable part of your
trade was the commerce in opium. The use of
this drug, we observed, was destroying the
health and the morals of our people, and we
therefore prohibited the trade. Your merchants,
however, evaded the law; opium was
smuggled in, till at last we were driven to take
the matter into our own hands and to seize and
destroy the whole stock of the forbidden drug.
Your government made our action an excuse
for war. You invaded our territory, exacted
an indemnity, and took from us the island of
Hong Kong. Was this an auspicious beginning?
Was it calculated to impress us with<span class="pagenum">[361]</span><a name="index361"></a>
a sense of the justice and fair play of the British
nation? Years went on; a petty dispute
about the privileges of the flag&mdash;a dispute in
which we still believe that we were in the right&mdash;brought
us once more into collision with you.
You made the unfortunate conflict an excuse
for new demands. In conjunction with the
French you occupied our capital and imposed
upon us terms which you would never have
dared to offer to a European nation. We submitted
because we must; we were not a military
power. But do you suppose our sense of
justice was not outraged? Or later, when every
power in Europe, on some pretext or other, has
seized some part of our territory, do you suppose
because we cannot resist that we do not
feel?"</p>

<p>These passages, one-sided though they may
be, give us some idea of what the Chinese
think of Europe, of the politics of the West,
and of our civilization as a whole, and we
cannot be greatly surprised that the yellow
empire looks upon us as its greatest enemy.
From the time that our first trading vessels
touched the coasts of China, closely followed by
men-of-war, the Chinese have been on the losing
side, both economically and politically. One
great Power after another came upon the scene
of action, and seized and occupied provinces,
many of them larger than their own European<span class="pagenum">[362]</span><a name="index362"></a>
dominions. When a Chinese schoolboy of today
studies the map of his country, and considers
how much smaller it has become in the course
of the last hundred years, how can it fail to
make him sad?</p>

<p>Almost ever since the victorious English
navy first made its appearance at Hong Kong,
foreign Powers have been occupied in tearing
away pieces from the empire. Russia owns the
whole northern portion of the land, and with
one stroke of the pen Count Muravieff has torn
from China and incorporated into the Russian
Empire the gigantic Amur district, or, as it is
now called, Eastern Siberia, the area of which
is almost larger than that of the whole of
Central Europe. Korea, once a vassal state, is
practically governed by Japan, while Tonking
and Annam have become French colonies.</p>

<p>Besides suffering these territorial losses China
has been compelled to pay heavy damages after
each war. In order to procure these moneys
fresh taxes have to be levied, so that it may be
said with truth that every son of the land&mdash;apart
from the ignominy put upon his national
pride&mdash;has personally to bear some part of the
burden laid upon his country. Such was the
condition of things at the time of the riots in
1900, and feelings have not greatly altered
since then, although on the surface all appears
smooth and quiet. The recent war between<span class="pagenum">[363]</span><a name="index363"></a>
Russia and Japan has roused the people afresh;
and do we wonder at the exultation which fills
the masses of the yellow race, now that one of
its nations at last appears to be getting the
better of its white opponents?</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>Will China, in case of need, unite with Japan
to destroy the common enemy? Will the Chinese
seek retaliation for what they consider to have
been an injustice done to them, and which they
evidently have not forgotten? It is hardly
likely&mdash;at any rate, not just yet. Japan and
China are now farther apart than one would
think possible, considering their close geographical
vicinity, and the cultural analogy
which till recently existed between them.</p>

<p>Looked at from a distance, and when one
does not know all the circumstances, certain
kindred features may stand out prominently;
but the likeness vanishes when one comes to
live amongst them. As a matter of fact, a
greater dissimilarity can hardly be imagined
than that which separates China from Japan.
The difference may be traced throughout their
past and present histories. Corporeal build
and manner of thought, state organization,
government and system of education, all were
different. Their similarity begins and ends in
the basis from which they both started, namely,
the old Chinese civilization founded on Buddhist<span class="pagenum">[364]</span><a name="index364"></a>
principles, and early borrowed by Japan
from China. The Nippon of the past had no
national culture. From China, across Korea,
Japan received the doctrines of Buddha, of
Confucius, of Mencius, or Thao. From China
also came the first scholars, artists, and writers.
What to us are the Greek and Latin classics
the writings of the old Chinese academicians
are to Japan. Upon them the Japanese have
based their views of life; from them their
artists received their inspiration, and the ideas
conceived in China found expression in Japanese
literature. As with us Latin, so in Japan
Chinese is the language of ancient literature.
It is probably owing to this circumstance that
so many erroneous views exist in the West
concerning the mutual relationship of these two
Eastern nations. They are always being mistaken
the one for the other, their virtues and
failings confused, their good and bad points
confounded.</p>

<p>Formerly everything that came from the
borders of the Yellow Sea was simply called
"chinoiserie," and now in the same way everything
that arrives from there is called Japanese.
It would seem as if Europe even now could not
distinguish between them; above all, as if we
were unable to realize the psychological and
metaphysical differences of the two nations.
We do not judge by what is essential, real, and<span class="pagenum">[365]</span><a name="index365"></a>
original, we only go by outward appearances,
by what is conspicuous at first sight.</p>

<p>And now, since Japan has made its mark
in the contest with Russia, it is only its external
success which causes us surprise, the internal
change of the people leaves us unmoved. The
public of Europe is strangely ignorant of the
moral worth of Japan. The interest of the
moment is concentrated on the little Japanese
soldier, who handles the British gun so dexterously,
who blindly rushes into danger, and dies
by thousands. And all one knows or cares to
know about China is, that it is backward, dull,
and stupid.</p>

<p>But as regards the real cause of the present
relations, and whether there is a possibility of
further developments&mdash;this is a matter of small
interest to the general public. The nations of
Europe seem to be as little concerned to understand
the inner qualities of the peoples on the
Yellow Sea, their psychological divergences and
moral strength, as they trouble to know the
history of their early culture and intellectual
existence.</p>

<p>This want of interest is noticeable in all our
dealings with the yellow races. In industrial
undertakings we constantly confuse China and
Japan, and Japanese goods often pass for
Chinese. Even those who profess to have
studied the history of Japanese art have been<span class="pagenum">[366]</span><a name="index366"></a>
found to attribute to Japan the fundamental
ideas which originated in China. The more
one comes into contact with Chinese and
Japanese works, the more clearly one sees that
the honour of originality and initiative belongs
to China.</p>

<p>The celebrated Japanese painters, sculptors,
and bronze-workers were taught by China; they
were clever imitators of Chinese art. In point
of execution they have doubtless in many cases
surpassed their masters. The detail work of
Japanese art is decidedly finer and better finished
than the Chinese, and in the work of reproduction
they have attained a degree of perfection
unparalleled in any other industrial nation.
But this, after all, is rather a matter of skill
than of genius. The artistic conception, the
creative power, was far more original in ancient
China than in ancient Japan, and although the
minutiæ of Chinese art were often crude and
imperfect, the fundamental idea was always
noble and grand. We notice this particularly
in their architecture. China's marble and stone
yamens and pagodas were imitated by Japan, but
with this difference, that they are built of wood
and roofed over with shingles or thatch. In
the various branches of sculpture and painting
we see the same divergence. The Japanese was
always an excellent copyist, but he drew his
inspirations from China, in much the same<span class="pagenum">[367]</span><a name="index367"></a>
manner in which the masters of the Renaissance
school used the antique masterpieces for their
models.</p>

<p>Just as the Japanese imitated and appropriated
the customs and institutions of the
ancient Chinese Empire, so they have now,
with astonishing rapidity, adopted European
civilization. Their power of assimilation is
incredible. When we compare the Japan of
today with the land as it was five-and-twenty
years ago, our surprise is fully justified. From
being under the most antiquated feudal system,
the empire has suddenly become one of the most
progressive states. At the Mikado's command
all things were changed: government, army,
education, even national views of life and
ideals. The authority of the Shogun is replaced
by a parliament. The descendant of
the old Samurai becomes a soldier, moulded
after the German pattern. The agricultural
classes are gradually transformed into factory
hands. From day to day the old institutions
and beliefs are being destroyed, and with the
new constitution a new religion is also called
into existence, or rather the obsolete and somewhat
obscure Shinto cult is converted into the
religion of the state. How much of real conviction
there has been in this magic change
or how much of it has been the work of natural
evolution, it is difficult to say. Inward convictions<span class="pagenum">[368]</span><a name="index368"></a>
and the problems of moral satisfaction
are outside the pale of politics. Whether the
present-day Japanese, who wears a silk hat,
is happier than his ancestor with his kimono&mdash;whether
the workman in the factory is more
contented than the former agricultural labourer&mdash;whether
the internal peace of the land is
better secured under the new system than it
was under the old régime&mdash;who shall say?
It will even remain doubtful whether their
thirst for glory was not more gratified when
guarding the frontiers and the territory of
their ancient Daimios than now, when, according
to Western notions, their chief object is
occupation and material gain.</p>

<p>The most serious of all future eventualities is
evidently whether these rashly accomplished innovations,
and the total transformation of all
existing conditions, may not, as was the case in
Europe, lead to a material and moral crisis.
In the most progressive circles of the land this
is a much-discussed point. The recent labour
riots, and the continually occurring strikes in
the great cities, cast a certain shadow over the
possibilities of the future. Baron Ivasaki,
the greatest industrial power in the land, whose
ships frequent all parts of the world, who has
banking connexions in all commercial centres,
who employs a large number of clerks, and has
every opportunity of investigating the labour<span class="pagenum">[369]</span><a name="index369"></a>
question in all its details, has published some
interesting articles on the social questions of
Japan. Another prominent Japanese writer,
Okuma, occupies himself chiefly with the moral
condition of the people, anticipating with fear
the time when the innate religious feeling, and
the once imperturbable loyalty to the Head of
the State, should be shaken to its roots. The
ultimate crystallization of the economic and
moral relations of future Japan is, after all,
the most interesting problem which this nation
at present offers.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>The reason that China still delays its reorganization,
and cannot blindly follow in the
footsteps of Japan, lies chiefly in the internal
constitution of the land. The population,
which is above all things peaceful and cautious,
waits to see what effect the transformation has
upon Japan, whether it is really for the good
of the people. The above-quoted passages
from the works of Chinese writers clearly show
that the Chinese as a people do not covet either
military glory or exorbitant material wealth.
For them the basis of happiness is peace and
stability. The disturbance of harmony is irksome
to the nation. This was the initial
thought which prompted them in olden times
to build a great wall to protect their native
land from foreign intrusion. The Chinese are<span class="pagenum">[370]</span><a name="index370"></a>
now beginning to realize that the highest wall
cannot stem the current of time; that progress&mdash;or
let us say the course of events&mdash;sweeps
away even the mightiest obstacle before it.
The necessity of their ultimate reorganization
is more and more apparent to those natives
who have come into contact with the outer
world; only, as Chang-chi-tung said, "It
cannot be expected or desired that we should
be transformed in the twinkling of an eye."</p>

<p>The more impetuous advocates of reform,
the representatives of the so-called "Progressive
Party," have their headquarters at Shanghai.
The members of this faction are mostly educated,
travelled persons, speaking several European
languages, students who have finished their
university career, officials, merchants, and
authors. Some amongst them, on account of
their revolutionary tendencies, have been banished
from Pekin or from the interior, and
reside in the European quarters and districts
governed by consular magistrates. These are
the leaders of the discontented. They reject
all existing conditions and demand the total
abolition of the present system of government.
But the man of the day I should say is Yuan-chi-kai.
It is he who represents the Progressive
Party at the Court of Pekin. To his
influence may be attributed the various reforms
introduced during the last few years, and the<span class="pagenum">[371]</span><a name="index371"></a>
notable changes in the politics of the Tsung-li
Yamen. Of all the viceroys of the united
empire he is the one most directly in touch
with the representatives of foreign Powers.</p>

<p>Yuan-chi-kai is in the first instance a military
leader. His policy, which is to secure
peace for his land, is based on military principles.
It is probably at his instigation that a number
of young Chinamen were sent at state expense
to Japanese universities, in order that they
might there study the effect of the imported
reforms upon an Asiatic nation already imbued
with European ideas. To a Chinaman
all these institutions would appear in Japan
in a more intelligible form than in Europe,
where all conditions are so absolutely contrary
to their preconceived notions. Perhaps, in his
capacity of soldier, Yuan-chi-kai also hoped
that the Japanese might impart some of their
military enthusiasm to the lethargic youths
of his country. So far the results have been
satisfactory. A residence in Europe has seldom
proved of much benefit to Chinese students,
but a visit to the universities and schools of
Tokio, Yokohama, or Kobe, has seldom failed
to answer its purpose.</p>

<p>The already modernized Chinaman is doubtless
an interesting figure, and he displays highly
intellectual qualities. Life in the harbour
towns, where he has free intercourse with<span class="pagenum">[372]</span><a name="index372"></a>
foreigners from all parts of the world, has considerably
widened his field of vision, and offers
him ample opportunity for making comparison
between the natives of the various European
countries. It enables him also to become more
familiar with the achievements of Western
culture. The latest products of French industry,
Manchester goods, or any of the most recent
European inventions, reach these shores within
a very short time. There are many wholesale
merchants and bankers who have for several
years been in direct communication with the
city of London, or Wall Street in New York.
They are bold and enterprising men, and work
their business exclusively on modern principles.
Their offices are fitted up in European fashion
with telephones and type-writers; only here
and there a rare plant, some precious object
of art, or a singing bird in a cage, betrays the
native instinct of love of nature and art. The
national dress is still worn, and the wide silk
trousers and traditional pigtail strike one at
first as somewhat out of place in these modern
surroundings.</p>

<p>At Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tien-tsin, one
has excellent opportunities of seeing the business
man at home. During my stay in those
towns I thoroughly enjoyed the social intercourse
with these people. It is interesting to
ponder over what may become of them as<span class="pagenum">[373]</span><a name="index373"></a>
they continue to acquire all the advantages
of Western accomplishments. What possibilities
this nation possesses!</p>

<p>The millionaires generally build their houses
in European style. The furniture of their reception-rooms
is also of foreign make, and only
the beautiful porcelains and other art treasures
remind us that we are in China. Honestly
speaking, all this modernization in house-building
and furnishing is to be regretted, for surely
the Chinese yamen is more tasteful than the
European house of iron and brick!</p>

<p>Dress has thus far not been touched by the
fashion, and anything more beautiful than the
richly embroidered silk and velvet mantles of
the wealthy classes can hardly be imagined.
Neither has Americanism been able to obliterate
the old-world manners and rules of courtesy,
or to sever the bond of family affection and the
inborn respect to parents. A Chinaman protects
his home above all that is dear to him.
In my intercourse with the Chinese I have
noticed that even the most advanced among
them, who have lived for years in England or
in France, and who have enjoyed all the advantages
of our commercial and industrial achievements,
scrupulously avoid imitating the private
life of the West. All that relates to business
is zealously excluded from the home, and it
frequently happens that the wife or the child<span class="pagenum">[374]</span><a name="index374"></a>
has never entered the office of husband or father,
nor does the father ever mention business
matters in the home circle. The office is for
work, he says, the home for rest.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked to me that with
us the wear and whirl of business and of excessive
ambition, destroy the joy of living.
One of my acquaintances at Hong Kong once
said, "The conditions of life in the West nowadays
make man his own enemy. He sacrifices
his whole life to acquire what is in the main
worthless, without giving himself time to enjoy
what he already possesses."</p>

<p>A banker expressed himself in a similar
manner. "Most people in Europe," he said,
"love money for its own sake, but not for what
money can do to ennoble their lives."</p>

<p>The more intimately I have become acquainted
with Chinese mood and thought, the
better have I learned to understand the psychical
condition of the people. It has been said
that the Chinaman, when first he comes to
Europe, is struck by the sad expression on all
the faces. They say that the Anglo-Saxon, or
perhaps more still the Latin nations, appear to
be more upset by some paltry superficial annoyance,
a social slight or deception, than the
Chinaman is at the sight of death. They say
that we prize exorbitantly what is of small real
value, while the things which make life worth<span class="pagenum">[375]</span><a name="index375"></a>
living and give inward satisfaction are neglected
by us. And I must confess that I have not
been able to confute this statement. Life in the
West&mdash;that is to say, the stability of the moral
equilibrium of existence&mdash;is very precarious.
Steam-engines have long since killed all sentimentality
in us, and deeper feelings are only
too frequently sacrificed to outward appearances
and conventionalities. Where even the
basis of religious conviction fails, there is
nothing left to compensate for the vicissitudes
of life.</p>

<p>The Chinese Christian, as the progressive
element of the land, desires above all things
that his children should lead pure, Christian
lives, a point which is frequently neglected with
us. I have known many Chinese Christian
families. I have been in the houses of simple
labourers and in the huts of peasants, as well
as in the mansions of the wealthy, and I have
found, as a rule, with poor and rich alike, that
charity and brotherly affection are not empty
terms, but that they find expression in their
daily life. Their care for the poor and needy
is quite touching. Such at least has been my
experience, and I have heard the same from
missionaries who have spent their lives amongst
them. The charge of insincerity, which is so often
brought against the Chinese converts, is greatly
exaggerated, at any rate as far as the Catholics<span class="pagenum">[376]</span><a name="index376"></a>
are concerned.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the greater portion
of the Chinese Catholics have been Christians
for many generations, and receive regular religious
instruction. The arrival of the first
missionaries dates back to the thirteenth century.
It was Kublai Khan who invited them
first to settle in the country, and in course of
time he entrusted the education of his son to
them.</p>

<p>More than six hundred years have passed
since the foundation of the bishopric at Pekin;
Monte Corvino was appointed first bishop by
Pope Clement V, and Marco Polo, the famous
Italian traveller, accompanied him. Six thousand
baptisms took place in the course of the
three following years, and the number of Christians
soon grew to a hundred thousand. Frequently
recurring persecutions hindered the
spread of the gospel; however, it is not my
object here to trace the history of Christianity
in China, a question I deal with in another
volume, but rather to point out that the
descendants of those early converts have embraced
the Catholic faith already as the religion
of their fathers. With regard to the so-called
forced, or paid conversions, I must mention in
the first place that adult conversions very
seldom occur, and have seldom brought the
person concerned any material advantage, but<span class="pagenum">[377]</span><a name="index377"></a>
on the contrary exposed him to injustice and
persecution. A Chinaman rarely renounces or
changes a once settled conviction, and the
greater number of baptisms recorded were
administered to the children of Christian parents
or to orphans and deserted boys, and especially
girls, who, without the intervention of the
Church, would have died of starvation or neglect.
Such children are put in orphanages under the
supervision of nuns, and taught a trade which
afterwards enables them to provide for themselves.
The more talented among them are
educated in the Middle Schools belonging to
the Mission, and in the colleges established in
the larger towns. The administration of these
institutions is in the hands of the clergy, and
their popularity is best proved by the fact that
a considerable number of their students profess
other religions.</p>

<p>The children of the well-to-do merchant
class, before they can receive any appointment
or start on a foreign tour of study, generally
finish their education at one of these establishments,
which, especially in the harbour towns,
are of a very high standard. Their usefulness
and superiority are also universally acknowledged.
All classes of society, regardless of
creed, contribute to the maintenance of these
schools. The "Christian Brothers" at Pekin
have quite lately erected a large college on<span class="pagenum">[378]</span><a name="index378"></a>
entirely modern principles, which supplies a
long-felt want in the capital.</p>

<p>In spite of all these reforms, it will be long
before China acknowledges the superiority of
the West. Although public opinion is slowly
and gradually changing, this is not entirely
because the people recognize the superiority of
Western culture, but rather because they are
in self-defence obliged to make reforms in order
to ward off the dangers which threaten on all
sides.</p>

<p>To a Chinaman the ideal of happiness was
quietness and peace; the object of his civilization
to conquer and subdue the brutishness of
human nature, and to combat all desire for
violence. As a result of this education and such
a turn of mind which have been in force for
more than ten thousand years, militarism has
not only been banished from their social code
of law, but died out of the upper social classes.
From generation to generation the Chinese are
taught that the greatest of all virtues is equanimity;
can we therefore wonder that they do
not yet appreciate European civilization, which
appears to teach the reverse? If the Chinese
have been at last compelled to relinquish their
ancient views of life and to accept ours, can we
blame them if they do it grudgingly?</p>

<p>After all, it is only a question of time: how
long the Chinese can hold out, and stick to their<span class="pagenum">[379]</span><a name="index379"></a>
old civilization. It may be decades, it may be
hundreds of years. Time is a factor of only
secondary importance where it concerns the
transformation of a whole race. But the day
is coming, must come, when not only China's
four hundred millions, but the milliard of the
whole Tartar races shall, without exception,
adopt the European civilization, and all the
advantages of it. And if in that remote future
the question of the Yellow Peril should arise,
the consequences may indeed be serious. For
China would naturally remain hostile to the
West, and, in conjunction with Japan, be its
most formidable foe, so long as the two cultures
of the West and the East do not learn to understand
each other. Little as we really know of
the peoples of the East, still less do they know
of us. To remove the mutual misunderstanding
should be our earnest endeavour. And
this, though not an easy task, considering the
prominence which has been given to the existing
differences, is not an impossible one; for
does not the burden of it fall alike on both the
white and the yellow race?</p>

<p>When we shall have succeeded in dispersing
the prejudices existing on either side; when we
shall have learnt to appreciate the virtues of
the yellow race, and they shall have recognized
the nobler ideals which animate us; then the
two races, instead of opposing one another in<span class="pagenum">[380]</span><a name="index380"></a>
the battle-field, will, let us hope, offer one another
the hand of good fellowship, and the banner
on the one side of the united brotherhood will
bear as a device, "Mutual Aid and Help"
instead of "Aggression and Oppression"; and
on the other side, "Friendship and Confidence"
instead of "Violence and Mistrust."</p>

<p>Let us hope that the Chinese will benefit, not
only by our military equipments and material
achievements, but that they will also share our
spiritual supremacy, and above all learn or
recognize the fundamental principles&mdash;the basis
of all true civilization, the Christian virtues of
Faith, Hope, and Charity.

<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"><a name="conclusion" id="conclusion"></a>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>The foregoing chapters were written on the
eve of the war. Since that time the situation
is, to some degree, altered, though not so
essentially as might be imagined; and I even
believe the general feeling to be, to a certain
extent, the same today as it was yesterday.
Neither party is entirely satisfied; the interests
and aims of neither the one nor the other seem
to have been fully realized, and both appear to
have lost more than they have gained in the
lengthy, costly, and cruel war. On the one
side, the Russians have had to renounce the
most valuable provinces of what they regarded
as their former acquisitions, whilst the Japanese
have not been compensated, either by the definite
annexation of Korea or of Manchuria.
The political situation is fundamentally identical
with that of yesterday, or rather with that of
a decade ago. The Peace of Portsmouth does
not alter the <i>status quo</i> much from what it
was after the Treaty of Simonosaki, still less
from what it was before the Alliance of Chifu.</p>

<p>The problem of the domination of Eastern
Asia is not solved; the two great races, the<span class="pagenum">[382]</span><a name="index382"></a>
white and the yellow, with their conflicting
interests, are striving for the mastery as before.</p>

<p>The Peace of Portsmouth might more justly
be called an armistice. A truce has been concluded,
and we hope that this truce may be of
longer duration than the last. And, above all,
let us hope that it may really tend to the well-being
of the countries interested, and of cultural
and moral advantage for the nations concerned.</p>

<p>Though the Peace of Portsmouth may be
unimportant, the moral influence of its articles
is all the more real from a purely material point
of view. Japan, in spite of her admirable self-restraint,
has become one of the Great Powers,
and she shows her strength, her security, and
her power, more especially by her moderation
and self-control. The renunciation of certain
points and the ratification of many conditions
required, undoubtedly, a self-control and a
political foresight which this young nation has
lately proved she possesses. After an unexpected
succession of brilliant victories&mdash;when
the fleet of her rival had been annihilated, the
forts of Port Arthur laid in ruins, the hostile
armies forced back step by step&mdash;it was hardly
credible that Nippon would refrain from insisting
upon complete evacuation of Manchuria,
annexation of Saghalien, and at least a certain
amount of war indemnity.</p>

<p>Was it not natural that Count Witte should<span class="pagenum">[383]</span><a name="index383"></a>
inform his depressed countrymen with satisfaction,
that Russia is still as much a Great
Power in the Far East as she was before?
Was it not pardonable if this piece of news,
and many others of a similar kind with regard
to Russia's diplomatic acquisitions, gave rise to
tumult in the streets of Tokio, and, at any rate
among the lower classes of Japan, to loud expressions
of dissatisfaction? Such spontaneous
manifestations of a people's feelings are easily
understood and cannot be taken amiss; but
these people, in spite of their dissension, will
daily recognize more and more what uncommon
astuteness has been displayed by the envoys
of the nation, in their acceptance of the present
and, to some extent, unsatisfactory terms of
peace.</p>

<p>Time will prove what were the motives which
chiefly determined the Japanese Government
to desist from further prosecution of the war.
Certainly the rôle played by the leading Powers
must have been an important one. It seemed
increasingly doubtful if the forms of future
loans would ensure the same interest for the
groups concerned. Anglo-American credit,
which Japan apparently possessed to an unlimited
extent at the outbreak of the war, became
circumspect and cautious to a degree.
Further financial undertakings, which, in consequence
of the unexpected and decisive defeat<span class="pagenum">[384]</span><a name="index384"></a>
of Russia, might have resulted in insolvency,
could of course not be agreeable to the French
and Continental stockholders.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/page_384.jpg" alt="Count Witte" />
<p class="caption">COUNT WITTE<br />
[To face page 384]</p></div>

<p>From an international point of view it was
desired that the situation, at any rate as far
as appearances went, should remain unchanged.
What was aimed at was equilibrium, not preponderance.
Opinions which made themselves
heard, not only in Central Europe, but also in
the English and American newspapers, showed
more and more plainly how critical the situation
would be if Japan alone possessed undisputed
paramount power in Eastern Asia. The leading
papers, which at first had been so enthusiastic
and described with such unbounded admiration
Japan's gallant battles and unexpected victories,
grew gradually reserved as the question of how
far Japan's ambitions might one day extend,
became doubtful.</p>

<p>Economic acquisitions were feared even more
than the actual strategic conquests. Already
a portion of the commerce of the Far East has
left European hands and fallen to the share of
Japan, and evidently this will more and more
be the case. The vicinity of the country, the
cheap rate of wages, the simplicity of social conditions
and those of labour, even at the present
day, all contribute to give Japan the advantage
in the competition. What their Government


chiefly covet, at any rate just now, are new<span class="pagenum">[385]</span><a name="index385"></a>
commercial spheres&mdash;safe markets&mdash;to profit
by the great wealth of neighbouring states.
By adroit commercial treaties with China, exploitation
of the mineral riches of Manchuria
and the Korean mines, Japan may, in a very
short time, not only make good her war expenditure,
but consolidate the economical condition
of the empire and increase the general
well-being.</p>

<p>From a political point of view, it can no longer
be denied that the Pacific Ocean will be, at least
on the eastern half, dominated by the Japanese
fleet. In short, it is this point which is the
essential one.</p>

<p>As I have already stated, Japan's schemes of
conquest, if she had any, would be directed
less towards the north than towards the south.
Siberia never seems to have had a great attraction
for her, and I believe that even Manchuria,
together with the Amur Provinces, leaves her
indifferent. She intends to let the original possessor,
China, reconquer it one day. Her far-seeing
policy seems to be governed by the assumption
that the Eastern Asiatic continent belongs to
her neighbours, the Chinese. For herself, she
wants to secure the position of a great Sea
Power. Her island home, and more especially
her sea-faring population, tend to guide her
in this direction. As factors to this end they
have not only subjective competency, but<span class="pagenum">[386]</span><a name="index386"></a>
the greatest objective possibilities. The Island
Empire of the Pacific is still, to a great extent,
with all her wealth, a <i>terra incognita</i>. We
may say the same of the South Sea Islands,
which are mostly only under the nominal
dominion of the white races. Honolulu and
the Philippines might one day be included in
the dominions of this newly-arisen great Power;
and her sphere of action will possibly create a
yet larger circle.</p>

<p>Australasia, even, might become the ultimate
aim of Japanese Imperialism and commercialism.
The climatic conditions of the
northern parts are such that Europeans find it
difficult to settle there, and in the limitless
sugar and coffee plantations the employment
of white labour has always been unsuccessful,
in spite of every effort. The number of the
white inhabitants is still very small, although
the continent was first occupied over a hundred
years ago. The original native tribes have
slowly died out; but the new settlers, over this
whole extent of enormous territory, do not
number as many as the population of London.
Sparsely peopled, she stands there isolated and
unfortified, defenceless, so to speak, in the midst
of the sea.</p>

<p>The actual guarantee for her independence is
offered by the circumstance that she forms part
of the British Empire. This dominion is of<span class="pagenum">[387]</span><a name="index387"></a>
course nominal; still, it is enough, at any rate
at present, to protect the continent from foreign
attack. But it is not hard to foresee what
would happen to Australia, with the adjacent
islands, Tasmania and New Zealand, should she
be severed from Great Britain. Indeed, it is
much to be feared that if ever the present
alliance between England and Japan were to
change into hostility, the former pupils and
friends might be obliged to turn their arms
against their instructors and allies.</p>

<p>Now, however, a truce has been declared in
Eastern Asia. The Peace of Portsmouth has
been concluded, and the consequences of this
recent event will undoubtedly be greater than
the bloodiest battles of the past few months,
although it occasioned less noise. I must
acknowledge that I am somewhat astonished
that the world which welcomed with such
jubilation Japan's victories at sea, seems to
fail to understand her greatness in the field of
diplomacy. Yet nothing was harder than to
find such a solution of the various antagonistic
problems as should ensure a free path for progress
in the future. After such glorious battles,
after the unchecked progress of an army intoxicated
with success, it must have been very
hard to halt, and to utilize this interlude for
future strengthening and eventual expansion.
Nothing could really have hindered the march<span class="pagenum">[388]</span><a name="index388"></a>
to Harbin or to the Baikal district. Even
the occupation of Vladivostok was merely a
question of time. But, as has already been
stated, it was not to Japan's interest to press
northwards, and still less to carry the day by
sowing the seeds of a yet greater hatred, and
exciting the conquered country to a policy of
revenge.</p>

<p>That, probably, was the reason why the
Japanese gave up the war indemnity, and hope
to refund it themselves from the agricultural
wealth of the strip of land annexed, instead of
from the Russian coffers. Japan did not desire
either to increase the animosity of her enemy
or to lose the sympathy of her allies. Above
all, she abstained from rousing hostility and
jealousy on too many sides before the definite
attainment of her goal.</p>

<p>The self-command evinced by the Japanese
is the greatest feature that, in the whole course
of her history, we have had occasion to admire,
it is even greater than her bravery, and this same
attribute was manifested in a remarkable manner
during the entire war. In the battles,
whether in their dealings with prisoners and
wounded, in slight advantages, or in important
victories, they strove to manifest their moderation,
self-control, and humanity.</p>

<p>Komura's task was no easier than Oyama's
or Togo's. To accept and carry into execution<span class="pagenum">[389]</span><a name="index389"></a>
the peace, in its present form, must have been
all the more distasteful in that the whole country
was against it and expressed its opinion in
an exceedingly hostile manner.</p>

<p>Yet, had the populace been more deliberate
in its judgment, they must have appreciated
the diplomacy of their statesmen no less than
the strategy of their generals. They may,
moreover, rest assured that the present peace,
though it may appear somewhat unjust to them,
will prove to be of as great benefit and of as
sure advantage as if better terms had been
arranged. Was it not so, in the case of past
victorious wars, especially as regards the terms
of peace concluded with little glory and renown
at Simonosaki and Chifu, which yet
contributed so much to heighten the army's
thirst for combat, and to develop the patriotism
of the nation? Undoubtedly Japan is reckoning
upon future eventualities and struggles in
which she will demand yet more courage from
her army and even greater enthusiasm from her
sons.</p>

<p class="break">*****</p>

<p>But for the moment, at least, we may look
with confidence to the Peace, and hope that
Nippon, which has won the admiration of the
whole world in the late war, will show herself
not less capable in time of peace. May she
assist the countries that have come within her<span class="pagenum">[390]</span>
sphere&mdash;especially Korea&mdash;to a higher development!
May she improve the conditions of
agriculture, industry, as well as of culture, and
truly strengthen all those moral, ethical, and
spiritual aspirations which alone make for the
positive weal of mankind! In one word&mdash;may
the Land of the Rising Sun earnestly strive to
cast rays of light on Eastern Asia!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
